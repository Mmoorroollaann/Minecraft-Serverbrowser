      <description>SoftEggLand is an experimental creative server set up by SoftEgg Enterprises, creators of Rhythm Core Alpha, a music creation system for the Nintendo DSi (now available in the Nintendo DSiWare shop for 500 Nintendo DSi Points).

We just want people to build the most impressive buildings and towers.
Mobs are on, but some areas are sanctuary.
Creepers are nerfed and won't damage your house/
hMod, Cuboid and WorldGuard protect your houses from grief. Ask a mod to protect your house.
CraftBook is active.
Kits are active for most materials, save for gold, diamond, and obsidian. I don't want houses made out of that stuff... it's tacky.

We are slowly adding cities and infrastructure. The new "Desert City" (/warp desertcity) is inspired by the architectual excesses of Dubai, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, and includes a working monorail, high-rise towers, and a cactus factory!

The new North Awesome (/warp northawesome) region is an undeveloped wonderland of forests and mountains, intended for great roman style buildings that harmonize with nature.

We have numerous trams and subway lines extending far into undeveloped areas, so there is plenty of room to develop.

Come to SoftEggLand, and build new dreams!

      <name>Haven Gaming's Minecraft Roleplay Server</name>
      <description>Haven Gaming's Minecraft server is a roleplaying-oriented, story-driven server.  This is not a 'freebuild' server where you go build huge monoliths, shoes or creepers to have people oogle over them.  Instead, builds are done in order to procreate story, expand on plot and drive the world.  In Haven you do not have access to /home or /kit.  There is no way to easily get back to your body if you die.  It is not vanilla, but to a normal user, it probably feels almost like it.

The world is Haven, and you are an immortal watching over it.  You have a choice:  to be reborn as a mortal, to once again fight as flesh and blood, or to abandon reality and succumb to the eternal collective consciousness.  

If you do not choose to defend Haven against the approaching Darkness, then who will?  It is time to make a choice.

http://www.havengaming.net/?q=node/214 -- How to become a mortal?

Read the below sections to know everything, but joining Haven is actually very simple:

*Know the rules:  http://www.havengaming.net/?q=node/290

*Join the server at mc.havengaming.net

*Join TeamSpeak3 (http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads) at mc.havengaming.net:9987 -- you do not have to speak, only be able to listen and type!

*Ask very politely to be made an apprentice.  If you are lucky, then you can play!

*If no one is around, apply at our website at:  http://www.havengaming.net/?q=forum/12</description>

      <description>We&#8217;re a medium sized Minecraft community with a small capacity server that we will be updating soon. We have many plans to grow, and become a very beautiful yet organized server. We&#8217;ve already got some quiet impressive artwork, from Embermelts water house to Synapses floating spawn. We just got an economy system up and running, which we hope everyone will enjoy. If you&#8217;re interested in building, surviving, and thriving you should stop by. We have plenty to offer, and I hope to see you in game soon!

      <description>We are a Vanilla Server, which basically means we pride ourselves with keeping the server as close to 1st person as possible. That means there are NO KITS, NO FREEBIES, and NO SPOON-FEEDING. The server admin is PhuriousGeorge. Between he and the staff, we're always online trying our best to keep the element of challenge in this server as much as we can; so you actually have a feeling of accomplishment or joy when you complete a huge project or find a few diamond ores. 

Now this doesn't mean there's absolutely no difference between our server and single player. We stride to keep a laid back, friendly community going on our server at all times. We don't force you to do any one thing; after all it's Minecraft, you can do just about whatever you feel like doing!

The server itself is hosted on a Linux CentOS5 VPS, we have an auto backup running at all times in case the server crashes, so the most you'll ever loose is half an hour of work, and that should rarely, if ever happen. We have 50 slots at the moment, but we plan to expand in the near future as we get more donations, allowing us to upgrade our server.

Note: The voice of the community is definetly listened to. Changes are constantly being made due to demand and implemented based on availability of mods/tools to implement. We have a few programmers on our staff and will be cusomizing this server where needed to suit your likes! </description>

      <name>Age of Mining [100SLOT][MATURE ONLY][24/7Dedicated][RP][Medieval/Fant]</name>
      <description>The Medieval/Fantasy/Lore/Historic/Epic Build/RP Server

Register at http://ageofmining.com! We have an epic group of players, dedicated to Medieval/Fantasy building and RP. Take a look at some of our world below, you won't be disappointed!

What makes Age of Mining so Special?
Age of Mining is run by two dedicated admins that are willing to put the time and effort to build a great community. We have tons of minecraft experience as well as years of experience running dedicated private servers. Our first admin, (me), is an experienced web developer and will always be creating cool web features that will integrate minecraft into our website and forum. Our other admin is a seasoned linux admin with years of experience under his belt to modify and streamline our dedicated servers. We will work together to frequently bring you new mods and updates. We will also listen to the community to ensure that AoM is moving in the direction the players want.

Roleplaying anyone?
Age of Mining has dozens of cities, towns, kingdoms, castles, caverns, caves, huts, and mines with very diverse and creative RP stories to play by. We have players writing short stories, chronicles, and even chapters of books on our forum to play by in-game. Therefore, if forgetting about RL and immersing yourself in fantasy and medieval lore is your thing, then Age of Mining is for you.

A bit about Lesanthe:
It is a beautiful combination of flats, hills, water, trees, snow and icelands, castles, kingdoms, towns, forts, medieval cities, and more. There is something for everybody.

1. We are looking for new mature and intelligent users.

2. The server will reset now and again, so just re-join when it goes down because it's really fast. a "Reset" is just when I kill the server jar and start it again in order to load a new feature during these early Bukkit Mod days.

      <name>"Bloodbath" 24/7 PVP - Haklaslak.com</name>
      <description>Bloodbath is the real deal when it comes to survival SMP. There are no restrictions. There are no treatise on civilized combat. There is you, and there is that other guy that might kill you. Do you kill him in a preemptive strike? Or do you trust he won't stab you in the future... clans and warparties can ravage the population, but traitors are abound.

You decide.


Descent upon a wartorn and beaten world with no rules and only anarchy. There are no freebies, there are no hierarchies, there is only a fragfest as each and every minecrafter races to lop off the head of the next guy. So many servers highlight rules, PVP, civility and protection... pssh. Just frag the other guy here and win. THIS. IS. BLOODBATH! 

On this server, we offer the best SMP PVP community and a rock solid connection to the internet. The rest is up to you.</description>

      <description>Synapse SMP is where you want to be. All of us here at Team Synapse want you to enjoy a world where you can build incredible structures and civilizations that will stand the test of time. Come and enjoy the survivalist-driven atmosphere that encourages you to explore, mine, craft with your gathered materials, and battle against the creatures of the night in our natural world. Trade with players, sell your goods, become a driving force in our world economy. You are only worth as much as you work for! 

We at Team Synapse also strive to maintain order within our community and protect everyones&#8217; assets. Because griefers are a constant threat in the Minecraft universe, we have implemented a whitelist system where only players accepted to this list will be able to build or take away blocks. Also, we have a zero tolerance policy. If after an investigation you have been found guilty of griefing you will be immediately banned without question. 

We work hard to improve and update our Synapse world in order to meet our citizens&#8217; tastes! Our current player cap is 30 slots though with enough donations we will bump it up incrementally to sizes necessary to the amount of traffic received. Thank you for visiting us, and we hope you become an essential part of our growing community.


Current Plugins: 

WorldGuard, WorldEdit, FriendlyCreeper, CraftIRC, GuestBook, Essentials, MagicCarpet,Towny, LWC, MonsterHunt, iChat, Permissions, MinecartMania, Dynmap, and Reserved.

      <description>#Any questions and discussion are here: http://creepertown.no-ip.org/forums/index.php

Welcome to Creeper Town!

Creeper Town is mostly a survival server, most of our mods are for administration and anti-grief purposes as our aim is to be an almost 100% safe public server.

Since we are a public server, we are not running a whitelist, so everyone is allowed to join!

Our players mostly like to build all sorts of towns, we have a town made of sand, underground towns and just regular towns.

We have a lot of space to fill on the server, our player cap is at 40 players, so there shouldn't be any trouble with the server being full.

As I stated above, our goal is to become one of the safest servers out there, with no whitelisting, so we have a custom built mod called WorldLock.
This plugin is made by ObliviousOnion and he has made a nice little description for you below this text.

Keep in mind that we are running bukkit, only as a test, so the server might lack a few features and might get a little unstable.

The server is currently running a plugin called WorldLock 2.0
Wtf is this, you ask?

It's an anti-grief plugin!
While it's on, and functioning, every block you place is saved under your name.
That means the only person who can remove it is you, your friends, or a server admin.

Adding people as your friend, and letting them remove your blocks, is simple.
Type /wl add [playername] to offer them permission to remove your blocks.
They, in turn, must type /wl add [yourname] to grant permission.
Permissions go both ways! If they can remove your blocks, you can remove theirs.

To retract permissions from a player, type /wl remove [playername].
This undoes any prior /wl add you may have done in the past.

To see who you have permissions with, who you've offered permissions to, etc, type /wl list.

Just typing /wl or /wl help brings up a handy ingame help message.

If you want to find out who placed a block, right click on it with a golden pickaxe. Anyone can do this, and it will display a message stating who, if anyone, owns the block in question.

Credits for this plugin goes to ObliviousOnion
Thanks!


Rules:
#1 Griefing is absolutely not tolerated on this server, any form of griefing will result in a permanent or, in some cases, a temporary ban!

#2 Hacking is not tolerated on this server, you will only get ONE warning before you are presented with a temporary, or permanent ban!

#3 Getting permanently banned or long time temporary banned will result in your blocks getting deleted!

We run on a professional dedicated server, hosted in Germany with fantastic connection to players in Europe and across the globe (within reason ;) ). We have an extensive team of Moderators, Game Masters and Admins that are in game regularly to help. We ONLY promote players to staff positions after showing responsibility and dedication to the server, so you can be certain that your game experience won't be ruined by any so-called "badmins"! Our server runs hey0's fantastic hMod with a large number of plugins to provide users with a whole host of in-game commands, as well as giving our server staff members the ability to deal with any problems that may arise. Our server is greylisted (see below). This is to provide our regular members the chance to enjoy the game without fear of griefing or stealing from random outsiders looking to cause trouble, while still giving guests the opportunity to look around our world and get a feel of the server - as well as giving them a chance to prove themselves as a worthy member in our ranks!

Features:
Runecraft
Area Protection and Ownership
Monsters, Animals and Health
PVP (Arenas only)
Chest Locking
Fire and TNT Protection
MCBans Support
In-Game Economy, including Shops and Auctions

Chat-Channels and In-Game Chat &lt;==&gt; IRC relay
Help Tickets - Simple way to get staff assistance
Starter Kits &amp; Magic Torch
Regularly Updated Google Maps Interface
Private IRC Chat

And more...

Server Rules:
Read these rules carefully! If you don't follow rules, you will be banned! If in doubt, ask someone in game to avoid problems. :)
Don't grief, steal, or harass others!
Don't use or create banned Items (Flint and Steel, TNT)
Do always be respectful to all other players, regardless of rank
Don't ask for items to be spawned - Collect them yourself!
Don't use hacks, or abuse bugs, including duplicating Items!
Don't build anything offensive or pointless (e.g. offensive symbols or signs, 1 by 1 towers/holes, random floating water or lava sources, )
Don't advertise other servers
Do keep offensive language to a bare minimum

Server Information:
Our server uses a greylist - unlike whitelisted servers, this gives you the opportunity to 'try before you buy'. What this means is that as a guest, you may join our server, explore the world, and build in a dedicated Guest Zone, but not elsewhere. This method protects your world from griefers, without the draconian nature of a whitelist that forces you to apply to a server without knowing what it really is like to be a part of. After you've spent some time as a guest, if you decide you like the server community you can apply on our forums to be promoted to a member and get access to the large world area outside.

      <description>Server Info

Welcome to Penorzilla! The Minecraft server that is dedicated to providing the best RPG Minecraft experience ever!


Main Idea

Much thought and effort was spent to tweak every aspect of the server to create a very well balanced atmosphere whilst keeping all the original aspects of minecraft in the game and adding many more! We believe that diversity is key! We allow groups of players to join up, create towns together, go on dungeon expeditions, franchise and much more! We will also be developing dungeons that require multiple players (3+) and some that require even more to defeat them! Our economy is purely player based. The only way to gain money on the server by yourself is quests and killing monsters. You can in return take that money and purchase items from players or even save up to buy a town!


What is to come

We will be constantly adding new dungeons, content and quests for you to explore on Penorzilla. We will also be adding several features that only Member and Premiums get! I hope you stay around and enjoy what is to come and what is here!


Server Specs

8 Gigs Dedicated RAM

5MB Upload

3.2Ghz Dual Core

Server is my personal dedicated server that I built specifically for this server.


Lag?

Trust me if the server is lagging it is either

A: We're being DDOS'd and an admin is working on the issue to resolve it.

or

B: You are lagging. This doesn't mean you have a bad computer or internet connection. This simply means that the game is made with Java. Especially with the 1.3 update, the way the game connects to servers is very unstable. You can easily lag just by being you. So please do not spam "Lag" in the chat because that is honestly not going to fix it. If the server is lagging an admin is fixing it or it is just your client.



Rules

Here are Penorzilla we understand that in order to have a friendly and fun atmosphere rules need to be set in place.


Rules are not directly linked to a consequence in our case. Instead we base the consequence off how your reputation with the server is. If you are new to the server and you break a rule, depending on how bad it is you could get kicked. Where if you are a veteran to the server you might just get a warning and a second chance.


Rule 1: Griefing in any form is a bannable offense. This means no destroying an area that has obviously been made from another player. No adding things to an area that has obviously been made from another player, this includes water, lava and signs.


Rule 2: No advertising. This means no advertising other MC servers, products or anything that would direct the attention of the user away from the server.


Rule 3: No harassment. Harassment can be sexual, physical and emotional. If any negative vibes are sensed in your words or actions towards another member you will be dealt with accordingly.


Rule 4: Obey admins! When all is said and done, admins will always make the final call and the only person higher than them is me, Penorzilla. All admins are trained accordingly to deal with every situation and they know how to give out consequences.


Rule 5: No use of a proxy server to connect.


Rule 6: No intentional duping/exploiting bugs. Duping is where you are unfairly gaining an item in other means than the game has intended. This also means that any exploits you may have come across and you do not let an admin know, it is bannable.


Rule 7: No using client mods. The only client mod I will allow players to use is MiniMap mods that do not track ore. You may use texture packs and graphic changers as long as they do not give away specific blocks or entities.


Rule 8: If you are going to build outside of the town make sure its not just a pile of crap put together! If you are done with the area than pass it on to someone else or destroy it! We do not want excess crap all over the server just because you think it is your personal dumpster! This rule will be enforced severely!


I hope you take these rules into all seriousness and if you have any questions feel free to contact me via forums or e-mail.




Starter Guide


I understand what is below this line is a very long read through. You will benefit from reading the majority of it and it will help you out a lot in the game and people will appreciate you more for your knowledge on how the server works.


How to start!

You spawn in a permanent spawn point. Nothing in your hands and no money on you what so ever. It is almost like the server just splat you out of its womb and said good luck!

Trust me I know this feeling! That is why I'm writing this guide to help you out on starting you adventure.

First thing is first. Register a password with your account by doing "/register " From now on when you join the server you will put "/login " to login. This is so no one else can access your player data without your consent.

Secondly, What is your rank with the server? If you don't know just say something in chat and your rank will displayed.

Guest Rank: Welcome, you are the bottom rank but that doesn't mean your bad! As a guest you won't have much starting stuff to do so just skip to the next part.

Member Rank: Thank you for donating! As a member you get a free starter lot, all you need to do to get this type in "/pe open I would like my starter lot"and an Admin will respond and get you started (if no admin is online than please just skip ahead until one is online)

Premium Rank: Thank you for donating! As a premium you get a bigger free starter lot and some starting money! Just type in "/pe open I would like my premium kit" and an Admin will respond get you started (if no admin is online than please just skip ahead until one is online)

Alright! Glad to see you made it this far! Now we need to figure out what your calling in the game is! If you are a guest you will not have access to skills. Members will have 5/10 skills and Premiums will have all of them.

The way we've designed this game to work is like this: Money will always get you farther in the server. Knowing this you will either choose to play this game the most fun way, or the most economical way. You can be a brave warrior who fights monsters for they money they drop, be a merchant who buys low and sells high, become a miner who collects resources and than sells them to people, or even quest for a living! It is all up to you on how you want to pursue this!


Quests

There are two kinds of quests in the game. Your "Anywhere quests" and your "Story quests". Both of these quest types will be available to anyone! Anywhere quests are quests that have you collect something, kill something or do something particular to your surroundings and can be done almost anywhere. These quests are accessed by doing "/uquest" in game anywhere you want. Just follow the on screen steps and start collecting that wood!

Story quests are quests that do not use any commands in game. These quests are puzzles, stories and adventures! Quest points are marked with by signs, like the first quest is "King's Quest" that is found by the king inside the castle. You can see it says (Start) on the bottom line, which indicates to you that this is the starting quest. Just right click the sign to get a display of text that will help to the next quest point. These quest lines as we call them always end with a reward. The reward will usually be either a chest full of stuff, or a button on the wall, which when pressed will teleport you back to a certain area of interest and give you some items/coin. When doing quests note this: Some signs and bookshelves can be right clicked to display information. Not all of them can be, but it is good to check every now and than if you see one.


Trading/Shops

We understand at Penorzilla that not everyone is on all the time. That is why we introduced chest/sign shops that players can setup for absolutely free! Items required: 1 chest, 1 sign, 2 building blocks and the item you want to sell. Each chest/sign combination can sell and buy 1 item. It can sell and buy at the same time but it has to be of the same item. It is very easy to setup! Just place our two building blocks ontop of one another so you have two block sticking upwards, stacked. Place your chest directly in front of your bottom block, and place your sign directly above the chest, so it is on the side of the top block. For the sign this is what you need to enter in.

Line1: Leave line1 blank.

Line2: The amount people can buy/sell at a time. For example if you put 3 here, people will buy your item in groups of three, or sell to you in groups of three.

Line3: Price for items you are selling:Price for items you are buying. So if You put 6:3 that means you are selling your item for 6c and buying it for 3c

Line4: The item id for the item you want to sell. So if you are selling cobblestone than you would put 4. Just do "/search " to find out your items' ID

If you entered in the above correctly it should state that you made your sign shop successfully and your name should appear on the first line. If you were wanting to sell an item, just simply put the item (in any amount you want) inside the chest. If you are only buying than just leave the chest blank and when a player sells to you the item will be teleported to the chest.

Now if you want to buy an item from a shop, simply type in "/buy" and when you right click the shop signs you will buy the item on the list. If you want to sell, just simply type in "/sell" and right click the sign shop. These commands are toggle commands, meaning when you type in "/buy" you don't need to type in "/buy" again until you have typed in "/sell".


Skills

Here are Penorzilla we believe that the normal things you do should be taken to the next level! We offer 10 unique skills that can benefit you very much in the long run. There are two sets of skills. Set one, which require Member rank or higher to have, includes 5 out of the 10 skills. Th second set requires you to be Premium and gives you all 10 skills. Some skills have abilities as well. To use these abilities you must be Premium rank. Activate abilities by right clicking with that skills item. So for woodcutting you'd right click with a woodcutting axe. The ability usually only lasts for a few seconds, and has a 2 minute cooldown. Here is a list of skills, sorted by required rank and what they do.

Member Skills:

Woodcutting, Swords, Unarmed, Excavation and Mining.

Premium Skills:

Axes, Herbalism, Repair, Archery and Acrobatics.

Skills with abilities:

Woodcutting, Mining, Excavation, Axes, Unarmed and Swords.

To see a list of skills available to you and to see what your level is and XP do "/skills" in game. To see a detailed description of each skill do "/

Protection

At Penorzilla we understand that your chests/doors/furnaces/dispensors need to be protected so people don't steal your things. It is very easy to protect your said objects by simply doing the following:

Stand next to the item you wish to protect.

Figure out if you want to protect your item with a password, or if you just want to protect it based on player names.

Type in "/lwc -c private" if you want to protect it to your name. Type in "/lwc -c password " to protect it with a password.

Just simply left click the item and it will be protected!

If you want to add a person to a chest just do "/lwc -m " and they will be added, otherwise just give them your password!


Parties

Are you sick of having a mining party with a group of friends and you accidentally smash your friend in the head with your pickaxe? What about when you are with a group of people fighting another group of people and you don't want to do friendly fire? Well luckily at Penorzilla we allow you to party up with your friends which makes it so you cannot accidentally hurt the people in your party. To start a party do "/party " in game. Than to invite someone do "/invite ". If you have been invited to a party just simply do "/accept" to join the party.


Hunger

Does your belly ever ache in game? That pork lookin' mighty fine eatin'? Be a glutton no more! At Penorzilla we make sure your food never goes to waste! Over time you will start to gain hunger points. Once your hunger reaches 100 you will start to die of starvation! Your health will slowly deplete until you eat something. To find out what your hunger level is just do "/hunger" in game. To find out how much food replenishes your hunger do "/food list". I'm not going to go into details on when the interval for ticking down your hunger is, so best to experience it yourself!


Monster Hunting

Not much to say here, it is worth it finally to kill monsters! Each monster has 100% to drop a range of cash for you! So get out there and start killing!


Channels

We think that keeping an organized chat is key to how well the server feels. We have 3 different channels for players to talk in (for now). There is the Local channel, which is talking to anyone within 100 blocks from you. There is the Trade chat which is a global channel that is strictly for trading purposes. Finally there is the Global chat, which is used to just talk to other players globally. Do "/ch help" in game to learn more about what you can do. My favorite part is the player ignore command, ignore that pesty "noob"!


Bounties/PvP

What would be minecraft without the ability to slaughter someone for their goods? But wait there is more! What would being able to slaughter someone be if you couldn't get a bounty placed on your head and have hitman come after you to try to kill you?!? PvP starts as soon as you leave any town. PvP will always be disabled inside of a town since the law commands so! Once you are outside of the town you are fair game. This also means that players can place bounties on your head if you get out of hand, or even for the sheer fun of it! Those rich people always were meanies! Do "/bounty help" in game to learn more about how to start a bounty and accept a bounty. Once you have accepted a bounty you can do "/bounty locate" which will help you track your enemy down to the nearest 100 blocks. Just know that you can't take up a bounty without a contract price! It'll cost 10% of the bounty reward to pick up the bounty initially, but may you succeed it will be well worth it!


Global Laws

Law 1: If the chest isn't protected, it is free game! So protect your chests!

Law 2: Destroying someones house outside of spawn is considered griefing!

Law 3: Killing someone outside of a town is shunned upon, but not against the law of the wilderness!

Law 4: If you chop down a tree, plant a new one. Failure to do so will result in the nature gods killing you.




Ranks

At Penorzilla we believe that players should have some incentive to give back to the server. This is why we have developed multiple ranks that each have their own unique advantage to the game. There currently are four ranks within the game. Guest, Member, Premium and Admin. Do not worry! Guests can still partake on the majority of the servers adventures and yes they can build! We are here for the community, not the money!


Guest Rank

Guests as you read above require nothing to become one. We ask that you register on the website and obey the rules! Guests can participate in everything except for skills and additional rewards (coming soon).


Member Rank - $3

To become simply donate $3. You get the [Member] Prefix and you get access to 5 out of 10 abilities. Mining, woodcutting, unarmed, swords and excavation. Also as a member you get a free small lot inside the main town. You will get access to additional rewards as well once they are out! Also as a member you will get access to achievements and stats! This will allow you to see how long you have played on the server, how many times you died, how many blocks you broke and much more. Depending on these stats you will gain achievements. /stats and /ach for more information!


Premium Rank - $8

To become simply donate $8. You get the [Premium] Prefix (which is green) and you get access to 5 additional skills on top of the 5 that members get. These include: Acrobatics, axes, repair, herbalism and archery. Also as a premium you get a larger premium lot inside the main town and 100c starting money! You will get access to even more additional rewards as well once they are out!


Admin Rank

We are always looking for admins to join us in helping create a stable environment to play in. We require you be at least 18 years old and have a good mindset for dedication and responsibility. Currently we are looking for plugin developers that are skillfull in java to help create custom plugins for the server. We are also looking for admins that can develop quest lines and background lore to the server. If you feel like you can do an exceptional job at one of these things please shoot me a PM or e-mail me at admin@penorzilla.com.</description>

DankCraft is a survival based server with endless things to do! Build a house, and set your homepoint there to return at any point with the /home command. We have plenty of fun server locatins to warp to, including a massive dungeon system called Dankaria, where you can group up with friends and fight your way through dungeons full of monsters, treasure chests, and much more. Level up and try to rank highest on the server! DankCraft also has a dynamic economy, where players can sell their items to an "NPC Shop" chest in their home or town, and to other shops and players. This money can be used to buy items for other players, shops, or the World Shop which can be accessed from anywhere using chat commands. Players can level up their Mining, Woodcutting, and Farming skills to get bonus drops as their skills progress. We have a great team of Mods and Admins who are there to help, and can also protect your zones and lock your chests/furnaces.

Check out our forum post for a full server tutorial.
See you on -DankCraft-!</description>

It will be a survival RPG/PvE like server, you build your stuff/house where you want, we go on adventures, build grand wonders and kill nasty zombies. Rules are pretty normal, no griefing, no destroying others stuff unless of course, we have some sort of war event ;)

Completely new server so come join the fun! I'm totally willing to take critisism and suggestions for the server.

      <description>It's still heavily under development, but this is what it's going to be.

Generally, everyone can build. In the beginning starting players will have the obvious limits, once you keep playing on my server you will be granted a higher rank.
I won't promote per playing time, I will only promote if I trust you. And I'm and easy going guy, so gaining my trust won't be difficult.
We do not have a website, but if you need information you can always add me on steam: Divyak

The server is being set up, so mods are not really here yet.</description>

      <name>Tutorial Server by ViTi</name>
      <description>Learning how to play Minecraft, to grasp the basics of this game is sometimes hard to do. I've explained quite some people the processes of woodcutting, inventory and workbench crafting all to the complexer elements of bows and mobs. As a result I decided to setup a Visitor Center where you can get a basic tutorial, covering topics like crafting, ores and creatures.

The Visitor Center can be found on its own public Minecraft server hosted by [url=http://www.vitinetworks.eu]ViTiNetworks.eu[/url] and has been setup by [url=http://www.synge.eu]Synge[/url].</description>

      <description>Our PvP server gives players the standard experience in Minecraft survival. Start with nothing, earn your items and head out on the search for the rare DIAMONDS! Watch your back though, making your location easy to spot can open up the opportunity for other players to come and steal your thing! Or even worse, destroy your creations! There's no rules in this server other than to survive, and never go down without a fight. 

This server is running CraftBukkit with the following plugins:
&#8226; Simple Protect (Only used to protect spawn, there is NO protecting on this server!)

Notes:
&#8226; Take the easy way and hide, or go out searching for your enemies to try and gain items quickly.

Then you want the most fucking hardcore 100 person minecraft server you have ever fucking goddamn seen?

That's right, there are no easy-mode-pussy-pansy ways out on this 100 person Minecraft server. This is fucking lord of the flies. Every one is equal and you all live and die by the actions you make.

The current main fort is "LEGION" and is located about one minute N from the spawn.

This is Lord of the Flies. You must survive.

Machine is built on AMD Phenom II X6 with 8GB RAM, server software is running from ramdrive to avoid HDD bottlenecking, backups are made every 20 minutes. 
Currently max players is set to 7 because of low upload bandwidth, but i will improve it if i get enough people playing.
Border limit is set to 2000.

Post on the server forum for whitelisting.

      <description>The Catalyse Tech Colonization Server is free-to-play SMP Server. We're somewhere in between a Vanilla server and a Modded server. When someone needs some tools admins will be happily willing to provide you with some starting tools. We are currently running with PVP and Mobs on the outside of a large spawn zone.


Griefing Rules   
As of now we do not tolerate griefing of any sort. After we get settled and try to figure out some PVP mechanics we'll implement a system in which griefing is okay to a certain extent. If you think you've been griefed contact and admin in game or on the forums (admins names display as red in game). We also ask that you don't use TNT or Flint for evil, because Notch is Wotching.


Monument and Warp Protection   
If you would like to create a public monument and have it protected with it's own warp, you can head over to our forums and submit app.
1. Name of Area or Monument
2. Coordinates
3. Why you think the area should be protected
4. Who should be allowed to edit it

      <description>Helllooooooo!

Previously Happy Ending Survival, we decided to jump on the Freebuild bandwagon but offer a little twist- with the help of the Borderlands addon, we're able to provide two separate build areas for our players. Out in the sticks we have a rather large vanilla survival area- and when we say vanilla, we mean as soon as you're ranked as a Survivor we dump you out there and you're never seen again :D Freebuild offers a range of ranks to progress through that come with their own kits so you can build lovely pretty things all over the server! I'll go into more detail on the two different areas we have later on.


We're a 15 slot server and since we're externally hosted in the UK (by the lovely and amazing Multiplay, might I add) the server is up 24/7 except maybe once a week when we tweak things or need to sort an addon out. The server offers two different modes of game-play which is handy for people who want to play with friends but don't necessarily want to play the same kind of mode. It is possible for us to swap you between the two areas if you decide you're sick of getting chased by chain gangs of spiders or you'd like a more vanilla experience, but we do advise you to stick with what you pick, at least for a little while.


I'd also like to point out we don't give build rights to people who haven't signed up on our forum, which can be found here:

http://happyendingsurvival.proboards.com/index.cgi

We use this kind of application because most people can't be bothered, and we only really want to play with people who can be bothered :P Also, as more of a benefit to yourself, please don't apply if you don't think you'll play often. We tend to smother people with love if they take the effort to sign up and you don't want to break our little hearts by leaving us, do you? :(


Well, that's about it from me! Remember, our forums are here: http://happyendingsurvival.proboards.com/index.cgi if you decide you'd like to come play with us! Pictures and various other things are on there (or, more truthfully, pictures will eventually be up there) and you can enquire further about the server if you'd like to know more.
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions on Steam, my addy is corvidae666
If you'd like to join the Steam group we have, again, feel free to add me :)</description>

      <description>We are an economy based server running on a gold standard to back our currency.  We do require membership to build which is free.  We have our map sectioned off in two main areas, open build and mining area which will get reset every so often, and purchasable land area where you must pay using in-game currency to have land.  

If you are looking for a server based on economy and creativity free from griefers then come check us out!  Currently we do allow PvP but it is not the primary focus, excess PvP abuse is considered griefing!</description>

      <description>Hey there!

The Dusk of Nobility server is a freebuild/survival hybrid server. We're a place were people can come and build projects knowing that they'll be protected, While also having to make  sure that they're not attacked by any sneaky zombies.

Our 45 slot server runs on a box which uses Dual 'Nehalem' Quad Core Xeon 5520 (8 CPU Cores to 16 with Hyper-Threading) with 3GB of RAM and a 1000mbps Redundant Connection.

We do not run a whitelist, Instead all players are offered to join our server as guests/builders with /kit spawning and /warp access so that players can explore the server and see if it's right for them. There are clear instructions how to gain higher levels within our server at spawn, You can also find out this information by using the /register command.    You can also visit our website at Nobilitygaming.com. We also run a ventrillo server if you want to have a friendly chat with us.

We have a great Moderating Team which consists of several Admins and Mods, We're also hiring if you want to apply. </description>

Or, even better, we have a kits system in place that corresponds to item ID's to make it easier for you to get stuff.

Protection is also offered to created which will keep away the griefers + the server is protected by MCBans.

Join our ever increasing community.

We don't believe in pushing down on users with a rulebook. A server should be inviting!

MULTIWORLD - iMine now has the Nether. Plus more worlds coming soon!

Item and player health is now disabled. You can also fly in boats or use them as submarines. The fun continues!</description>

It's a great server with lots/most of land still yet to be explored, but if you arrive at night not to worry there is a safehouse for you to spend the night till morning!

This is a fair server, although pvp there are strict rules on things like griefing, at the end of the day we are here for fun!

Great server with a little of RPG on a side :P to make the time playing even more fun!

You can build freely. 
You can buy land for protection for in-game money. 
In-game money system, chest locking, auction system, global shop, stack command, leveling system for tools to make the life harder xD (will be implemented with multi-drop when it's finished), world ranking system for the amount of land you own from commoners to kings.
Craftbook comming soon.

PvP is ON, you can kill anyone in non protected land and take they're stuff (excessive killing for fun not allowed)
Mobs are ON
Admin don't abuse his powers, plays like everyone else (smart one too, you can kill him and all he could do is yell at you, he fallows all the rules as well)
GM's have very limited powers (never abuse them too)



p.s. this is a hard server to play and don't forget to read the sign on the spawn ^_^</description>

      <description>Come join our humble community of 700+ registered user!

Witch is Hosted on our own private machine with a spec of :

100in 100out MBs internet speed.
4gigs of ram.
a core i3!

the minecraft server spec are:

30slot!
700+ registered user!
100%uptime! [exept for maintenance]

Q.what is this HARDCORE blasphemy?!

A.Survival at it best! [no block giving, monster spawn at nigth, creeper dont destroy shit but hurt]

We have a really active community forum, 
We are on twitter [monsieurDnet, twitting news and shit!]
and some more sweethies that i dont recall.

but here's the catch!:
you have to send a request to be accepted as a builder [you still can join the server, but wont be able to build anything at all]

Q.how can you do that:

A.send an email to: request@monsieurd.net

with your user name name, your forum name, a little introduction line, you age [you don't have to]
and how you got this server from!

is that easy!... no? i don't think it is hard, here's an example of the message you could send!:

[enter polite quote here]
my username is : [yourusernamehere]
im registered on the forum as: [yourforumnamehere]
i am XX years old [ you don't have to]

i'm interested in this server because [th rest is up to you] 
OR

      <description>Welcome to KPsN Minecraft server.

This server is running on Bukkit and has various plugins installed: IRCchat, Permissions, Cuboidprotect, MyWarps and many more.
With all those plugins the server has some nice features: live maps, stats, ingame stargates and multiple worlds including nether worlds!
For a full list of the features and plugins check KPsDen.com/minecraft.php
You can also follow us on facebook at http://www.facebook.com/KPsNetwork and on our own forums at http://www.kpsforum.com/forum/35-minecraft/

The server can be found at mine.kpsden.com.
After your fisrt login you need to register by typing /register &lt;password&gt; &lt;email&gt; in the chat, other players cannot see what you typed as your password.
You wont be able to build at first because you need to be added to the Builder group by KingPin or Pippin, if they are not online they are most likely on the IRC chat so you can just ask for them there or post on the forums linked above in the sticky post..

We hope you will enjoy your stay on our server :)
Kind Regards,

KPsNetwork</description>

A high spec server on a 100mbps connection means minimal lag, unlike those "servers" (Some poor spec desktop) in some kids bedroom with an upload of 0.3mbps at best (In laymans terms, very laggy)

To minimise griefers and/or arseholes, we operate a build rights system. So you can have a look on a server fist and meet the community. Then if you like it here, it's real easy to apply, just post an application on the Envisage 24/7 forum at envisage247.com</description>

Basically, here is how the server works:
The server is whitelisted. To get on the whitelist you email this email:  KidsAppeals@yahoo.com 
You must include the following in your application: MC Name, Servers previously been on, a little bit about yourself, and why you want on this server. I will then reply with a yes or a no. If you get a yes, I'll send you a list of the cities with pictures and descriptions. You will then choose your city. If you get a no, I'll tell you why, and you can appeal to get on. 

Enjoy and have fun!   </description>

      <name>NationCraft: War of Ages PvP, Factions, Bounties</name>
      <description>[bNationCraft: War of Ages

NationCraft's game style has evolved over the past few months into a very nice gaming experience for those who like to dabble in PvP with just a hint of Role Play.  

Prelude

Players join the server as citizens of the realm.  This realm is made up of several player created "Factions".  These Factions are constantly changing from small outpost to kingdoms of grandeur.  There are alliances made and broken.  Wars begin and end.  Bounties are posted and paid.  Merchants run markets, craftsmen build their treasures, and thieves steal it all.  There is just no limit to what you can do on NationCraft, it is all up to your imagination. 

Server

We lease a server from "Jestservers.com", this server runs 24/7 and gives us a very stable platform to run 50+ players with no lag.  Soon we are pushing to 100+ players as soon as we have the player base.

API

The server runs on CraftBukkit.  This is a big performance booster over Hmod.  Because CraftBukkit is still under development the plugins change slightly as CraftBukkit is improved.  Right now we are running CB#304

Plugins

We have put together a very nice set of plugins that give us just the right touch of control in the game to provide for our desired game play style.

Permissions - Provides us with the ability to only have certain groups using certain features in the game.

General - Gives general commands like /who; /time; /tp; /spawn ect...

BorderguardLite - Sets our map border

Guardian - Grief Protections like no lava (admins will place it for you), no minecarts ect...

Factions - This is the main plugin for the server.  Players can create factions, claim areas, set protections, and make alliances, or Wage WAR with each other.

HeroBounty - Very nice plug that lets players create bounties on other players.  Allows a player to accept a bounty and hunt down the player wanted.  Gives a reward through iConomy to the bounty hunter after the kill.

iConomy- Provides the economy in the game via "Shillings"

SimpleShop - A server based "Shop" where players can buy/sell goods to the server.  Used basically for rare items or things from the nether.  We use this to also boost the economy sometimes.

RepairShop - Used with iConomy, it allows you to repair your tools if you have enough money.

Game Style

Players on the server can do just about anything they wish.  Griefing of course is not allowed, but there also is not much griefing because the server allows for Wars and some level of destruction is going to happen at times.

You can join or create a faction whenever you want.  The only restriction is it has to have a minimum of two players at all times.

The main goal is to have players that interact with each other in ways other than just building.  Merchants, Crafters, Alliances, Wars, Bounty Hunters, Theives, ect...  it is all here!

How to Join

Server is a core i7 quad-core with 12GB of RAM, running Bukkit with lots of plugins on a 2GB RamDrive for optimal performance. We are adding more plugins by the day. Monsters are on, but creeper explosions are disabled to protect your builds.

Griefers &amp; trollers need not apply. Our world is thoroughly protected by WorldGuard, WorldEdit and LogBlock.  More protections are being added by the day.

      <name>Dysalot's Downtown Server NO whitelist! 95% Vanilla [iConomy] [bukkit] [Nether Portals]</name>
      <description>A small community of dedicated players working together to survive and thrive. You spawn in a Downtown oasis, safe from all danger but skeletons. You walk by the courthouse where court may be in session, past the tall towers. You come upon the wilderness. You are now free to build... and die. How will you survive? Will you team up with another player, will you make your own home? It is up to you.

There are anti-griefing measures (but most everything is allowed including TNT).  You spawn in a downtown area that is protected, walk any direction past the streets and you are free to build.  Be careful monsters are dangerous outside the downtown. 

NEW: We are running a scavenger hunt/puzzle to get a downtown lot.  Look at dysalot.proboards.com for more info.</description>

Featuring a TeamSpeak 3 server, the nether and a PvP arena for 'Capture the Flag'.

Even though the server's running on a powerful dedicated machine, we will switch to an even more powerful root server on march 1st.

New players will have to intoduce theirselves in our forum (http://minecraft.ever-baduk.de/forum) to get build rights.

That's it for now. To be edited. ;)
*We usually maintain the server at low-user-time and keep it up to date.</description>

      <description>Player kills/deaths rankings!
No whitelist
Free for all! Got a vendetta? Griefing his base is fiiine!
Piracy, looting, marauding encouraged :D

Just no transparent textures or hacking, please (Including MCCheat). Beyond that, there are no rules, so please follow the only one there is.

To add a bit of fear and meaning to the fighting, there will be an hour temporary ban when you die for the next week, after which the ban times will increase until we reach the targeted 2 hours.

Whether it be from someone lava'ing your base, a mob, dying to a cactus, or getting killed by another player, know that when you die or kill somebody, you've just locked them out of the server.

Have fun, team up and hide in some secluded area and try to build a civilized village in peace. Or gear up and hunt other players to prey upon their hidden treasures. Have a heart and lend some bread and pork to a newcomer or kill anybody on sight who just might be interested in your diamonds.

You can raid abandoned (or occupied!) bases in search for supplies and treasure, dodge traps left by other players and know that every building or temple you enter has a story behind it; the crevice with a lonely torch in it the remains of some other traveler taking refuge for the night, or the pork left in an abandoned chest might have been left for someone like you in mind...

Play your way! (within the rules) Cherish your buildings and your home, because you built them in the face of others coming to plunder.</description>

      <name>The Crafting Factions</name>
      <description>The Crafting Factions server is a hardcore PVP server. We don't have a whitelist and don't require donations for rights. TNT is enabled on this server, as is water buckets, etc. (fire spreading is disabled to stop forest fires)

The map size is set to 2048 square with BorderGuard

This server allows you to claim land (minecraft chunks) and go to war with other factions.
home and spawn have a warmup and cooldown to prevent abuse.
You can loot chests in other factions land.

Faction Faq:
Each player represents 10 power. 1 power = 16x16 area (1 minecraft chunk)
every death reduces your power by 3, all the way down to -10
you gain 1 power every 5 minutes up to your maximum of 10
your power is totaled with your faction
If your land claimed &gt; Power, other factions can CLAIM your land and destroy it.
TNT can destroy your land regardless. TNT cannons do work in the server

commands (run them in game for more help):
"/motd"
"/getpos"
"/faction"
"/home help"
"/mail"

      <name>-The Artifact- Hard-core PvP with a Mystery</name>
      <description>High atop the peaks of the Three Sisters, the artifact was found.


The first slicers to visit this world were surprised. When they popped into 
normal space in the world it was night. As expected, the undead walked      
about, but were almost powerless against the explorers. After a day and     
nights climb, they reached the summit of the tallest of the sisters and     
found it, a strange glowing configuration of what seemed to be powerful     
stones. The slicers theorized that it were these that provided protection to 
the world. In this they were nearly correct. 


As the explorers pushed beyond the three sisters, night fell again, and they 
were not so lucky. Faced with the reality of dangerous creatures beyond the 
mountains, they attempted again to slip between space and time back to their 
own world but found they were stuck. Could the artifact be holding them     
there? Was this a prison of some sort?

They'd need to survive first before searching for those answers... and a way 
out. Days and nights spent in the relative safety of the mountains brewed   
distrust among the survivors. Reasonable men at first, now they became      
paranoid and edgy. Which of the others would kill them first! One by one    
they struck out into the wilderness to meet their fate or build their       
strength.

Griefing is a term similar in meaning to vandalizing. 
This can be a wide range of things, but not limited to:
Breaking structures.
Adding onto structures you don't own or blocking an area on purpose.
Breaking glass that you did not place.
Placing water tiles or lava tiles in random locations to disrupt the area.
Placing massive amounts of duplicated items like diamond or gold blocks. [Also falls under duping]
One block towers or pits to the bottom of the world just to trap people.
Breaking chests and leaving floating items.
Making contraptions that, or throwing them yourself, make items to float on the ground. [Lags the server]
Breaking bamboo/sugarcanes, trees, or cactii that belong to someone (in claimed area)
Ladders are sometimes an exception. Read on them here.

Do not grief your friends as a prank, as it will still get you banned.

2a) Only help people in their base if they ASK for it. 
Do not build or mine around someones area or in someones area they have outlined and took the time to construct. If they ask you not to to build near their buildings or city, this is something you must respect. The map is big, you can take five minutes to find a new location.


2b) Do not grief in order to Steal

Stealing is permitted, seeing as you do not grief to get at the items. If you break any blocks, or place anything on the home or its property to get in, you will be banned. This includes building sky bridges over the home to drop in or to try to jump in, or tunneling underneath.


2c)Mines are an exception to the normal griefing rule.
If you enter someone's underground base having busted through natural material (smoothstone), then you need to leave, and repair it as best as possible. You will not be held responsible for griefing since there is no way you could have known a claimed area lay beyond. HOWEVER, players are not allowed to use that entry to go rob and steal from people's bases or bust up the rest of their walls in their base once you know its there. Doing so you will be treated as a griefer and illigitmate thief.

3) Do not exploit glitches, duplicate items, hack, or modify client
Things that fall into this category include, but are not limited to:
Fly Hacks- whether superman style or in a boat
Speed hacks
Duplicating items via the chest or inventory glitch
Duplicating items via unsynchronized rollback to inventory error [A roll back occurs, and the item is still in your chest, and in your inventory
Use a see-through texture pack to locate ores, mossy cobble or chests, or any specific block type.
Spawning items via a cheat client
Logging in twice or more on the same account name.
Keeping and not returning Admin spawned items for a project they asked you to do.

Being on the receiving end of hacked or duped items or posessing them will also land you in trouble. If someone hands you stacks of diamonds, its a red flag that they are duped. Report it to an admin and hand it over ASAP!



4) Do not create vulgar or offensive structures
Do not build or write signs that contain any thing that could be construed as vulgar or offensive.



5) Don't be annoying on purpose
Do not troll.
Do not harass players.
If a player asks you to leave their area, leave. (Needs to be for an extended time and actually count toward harassment, not pvp or stealing aspect)
Do not type in caps.
Do not spam chat.


6) Do not disrespect admins or players
If an Admin or Mod tells you something, you listen. This is not a debate, this is not your server. Just because you do not agree with them, does not give you the right to argue. 
Do not curse at the staff or other players insultingly.
Do not talk back rudely to a staff member.
When one staff tells you no, do not keep asking other staff members.
Impersonating staff in any form or medium



7) Do not beg staff for items
Begging an admin for items like coal or smooth stone is not permitted. If you need help, they will generally help you if you are nice about it. We are a friendly bunch of people, but don't push us.

8) Do not advertise other servers
Posting the IP, thread, or website of another server is not allowed, and will get you instantly banned.



9) Do not beg for higher position
Do not beg to be promoted, the staff will consider applications at our own pace. Begging to go up to a higher rank will probably only get you denied, or even demoted if you keep it up.

PvP Rules And Information

Do not ever attack a staff member! Mods, admins, supers, etc!

PvP disabled areas
Spawn City
Immediate 50 block radius area around portals
Cities listed on the City board at Spawn


Do NOT camp the warp roads.

Harassment:

Killing the same person without provocation (self-defense, anti-stealing and anti-infiltration kills do not count) more than 3 times every hour.
Threatening to continue killing or stealing until a person does x
Making people pay you to keep you from killing them. No mafia-esque behaviour.

You are not allowed to set your home location in someone else's area.

During PvP combat
Any impromptu huts to hide in or to trap others do not have the griefing rule applied to them.
Blocking up your previously established home is allowed, griefing rules apply
You ARE allowed to use armor!




Do not attack people reporting a grief or other breaking of the rules.

An admin needs to be able to talk with and work with people who are reporting rule-breaking. During the investigation, the reporter is not really able to defend themselves because they will be typing. Doing so will result in having to return the items, and possibly being kicked or banned for a short amount of time.

PInfiltration Rules and Guidelines

Infiltrating
Water bucket climbing/descending is not allowed.
No placing things on homes to get in. Buttons, levers, redstone torches, pressure plates, etc
You may place ladders on walls around a property, but not on buildings themselves, and once placed, they must be left there only to be removed by the owner of the wall. (See below)
You cannot break things in order to enter.
You can walk in an open door, or open a wooden one.
Do not build over or next to a building or area in order to drop into it.
Do not place anything to stack up to a floating area.
You are not allowed to plant a tree in order to get over a wall.
Do not tunnel under homes- its griefing

You are not allowed to set your home location in someone else's area.

This only applies to WALLS. Not to BUILDINGS. Do NOT put ladders on BUILDINGS/HOUSES

Ladders are place-able along walls.

Rules:
You may place a ladder to get over someones wall, but you CANNOT remove that ladder. This is to be proof of how you got in or out of an area.
Those ladders, once placed, belong to the player that OWNS that wall.

What is a wall?
Walls are inherently defined as:
An architectural partition with a height and length greater than its thickness; used to divide or enclose an area or to support another structure.
A wall in minecraft is a usually solid structure that defines and sometimes protects an area.
Walls therefore, have some sort of open area inside, and/or surround one or more additional buildings inside.

Walls:
Walls that fit the above description.
Terrain that supports the building up. Ie: cliffs, plateus, two block high plateus, etc.
Non-building platforms used for getting up into a floating area. (If its not hollow and is just a lump of w/e, it can be scaled.)

Not walls:
Buildings.
Trees.
Balconies.
Decks.
Stilts used to 'support' a house.


Buildings:

A building is a structure with rooms, floors, and basically is an enclosed hollow space. It may have a balcony, or deck. It may have a roof- it may not. It is any structure that does not qualify as a wall.


If you are unsure, there are two steps you can take
Go away 15-20 blocks and build a GRAVEL single tower to be able to see over the wall in question. Make sure to take down the gravel tower once recon is done.
2) Ask a staff member. If a staff member tells you its ok, you won't get banned for it. However, if the staff member was wrong, you will have to return the items.

ALL griefing rules still apply. Do Not break Modify or destroy anything, meaning if you climb a wall and you cannot get out, DO NOT TUNNEL YOUR WAY OUT use /home and go somewhere else.

To prevent people from getting over your walls.

Build a lip at the top.
Add Fences to the top of walls
Make a moat, Lava moat, or Cactii moat to prevent people from scaling your walls

___________________________
Governmentally, our server is run as follows:
*3 "provinces"; Lavenderonia, Ragusa, and Tafaldaysia
*The Spawn area (marked by rings in the sky) is more or less a "free-build" area, although there will be no protection within it.
*Outside of the spawn area one must get a permit before doing things such as mining, farming, and such. This is why it is encouraged to join a province, as the people within the province will help you through tough times to buy your land.
*If you say "Cah-caw!" in chat, people will know that you are insane and should be treated as such.
______________________
Owners of each province are as follows:
JamesLWillisIII: Owner of Tafaldaysia (also server owner)
Yippingbyrd: Owner of Ragusa

Due to non-English speaking "Griefers" we have moved to limited permission accounts access only. With that being said, you now have to register on our website http://athena-craft.com to be able to request being added to the whitelist.

We are working on an Private World Mod that way you can come online to our server and socialize and then retreat to your own private world where only you can access so as to be more secure in these times with all the "Griefers".

We currently have the Nether as an accessible world ready for you to play in should you decide to do so.

      <name>"Viking Realms" [24/7] is a completely LAG-FREE fresh started SMP server with up to 28 slots - Almost everything allowed.</name>
      <description>Viking Realms is newly founded (15-02-2011) and is created by 4 SMP players who had enough of looking for any good servers to join with no lag and no admin abusing their powers!

The core of Viking Realms is to scatter around the awesome map, build up your place either alone or with friends! To then go and sniff up the other players homes to raid or grief or do whatever you'd like!

Server is running on a VPS hosted by Fasthosts.uk on 3GB ram, 80GB harddisk and 2vCPU's with 100Mbps network speed! - All this means that the server won't lag before it exceeds 30 players - but with a cap of 28 that isn't possible!

Forum group is under development!

one important thing to note is, that we are 4 admins/operators on the server, but we will not abuse ANY powers that we may have, infact we have DeOP'd us so that it isn't a possibility

Uptime is 24/7!  - Any downtime is caused by moderating or re-starting the server, it will be up shortly after!

PVP is ON
No whitelist
No admins abusing their powers
Do whatever you like (including raiding, griefing, building etc.)
BUT NO SPAWN KILLING/BUILDING! - SPAWN IS A SAFEHAVEN WHERE PLAYERS CAN COME TO HANG OUT TOGETHER WITHOUT FEARING FOR THEIR LIFE!

Mods used:
Announcer
MultipleHomes (3)
Setspawn

Commands available:
Players can set a maximum ammount of homes to 3 homes at a time do this by "/sethome 1-3" and return to home by "/home 1-3".

Players can always return to spawn by "/spawn"

      <name>Just a regular SMP :)</name>
      <description>READ THIS!
this SMP has a town with houses and trading shops. there will be more but i made the server just  yesterday, so i'm still building. there will be a money system of some kind for you to buy things in the town such as tools, a house, etc.
the town is a safety zone but if you do venture out into the world, you're on your own. (pvp is on)
monsters and animals are off.</description>

      <name>Bart's Beach: Build your Legacy!</name>
      <description>You have 2 weeks to live. What will you build to cement your legacy in the sands of time?
When you start your life at Bart's Beach, your fate has been sealed. You will live for about 2 to 3 weeks before you die. And when you're time is up, its up.

Tombs are available for those who last their natural days. PVP is enabled, so are monsters. You have 9 accidental deaths, but when your time is up, its up. You don't have to leave, but you'll be doomed to walk the world as a ghost (yes, you CAN haunt the living!)

Come, build your legacy!</description>

      <name>Titan [Factions][Iconomy][LocalShops]</name>
      <description>The server is designed for people who want to have that a nation building experience where you build with a group of people and then play in a completely player controlled environment. Here your relations with other nations are of great importance because they could result in either ruthless warfare or a flourishing economy and a powerful kingdom. So bring your friends and join forces with them or join an existing nation and make new friends, but be aware that your nation will not be the only one residing on the cold world of Titan.

      <description>Hallo Minecraftler,

habe mir einen eigenen Server aufgemacht, mit recht frischer Map, eingenlich recht unprofessionel da ich auch nicht am meisten ahnung davon habe. (falls ihr tipps habt k&#246;nnt ihr es mir ja sagen ) ist auch kein 24/7 Server, aber ist tags&#252;ber eh meist an. W&#252;rde mich freuen wenn ihr mal meine Map anschauen w&#252;rdet und wenn ihr mitbauen wollt werde ich oder einer der Moderatoren euch freischalten wenn ihr h&#246;flich fragt.

      <name>Half-Craft</name>
      <description>Half-Craft is an Bukkit server, using iConomy, LWC Chest Protect, World Guard and much more. The server was founded back in December, but it has recently been revamped. Our community strives to be the best, and the way things were working in the past did not live up to our expectations. Now, Half-Craft SMP is one of the best servers to play on. We have a wonderful community with friendly Admins and Moderators that can help with any problems you may have. We are a HYBRID server, meaning that you can participate in Citybuild/LightRoleplay OR you can go out and adventure in the wild. (Vanilla gameplay basically) OR BOTH! There really are no limits.

      <description>This is the server where you can join and build, the rules are at the spawn, but they're here too.

1: Don't Grief.
2: Do not act like an idiot, use common sense.
3: Don't Loot chests.
4: Don't complain about lag once you first join, the map is loading.
5: Respect other players, especially moderators and admins.
6: Ask a moderator to protect you're house before you complain about it getting griefed/looted.

      <description>Our server is designed for experienced players that seek a place to build where they know their creations will be protected. We run a dedicated server in Dallas, TX. It has 2x Intel Xeon E5520, 24GB DDR3 RAM, 2x 250GB 7.2K RPM SATA-II HDD, 4000GB transfer @ 100mbit, respectively. We also have a Google API 3d livemap that is updated every hour as well as a dedicated Ventrilo server. Administration is online 24/7. We do not run a whitelist. Instead, we offer all players to join our server as a guest, complete with /warp access, so one may explore the server to see if it&#8217;s right for them. If it is, we have clear instructions on how to gain Builder Access at spawn and also on our website, http://exodusserver.com. We have adopted this application process to not only detour Griefers, but to filter out annoying children.
These features combined create a great, lag free environment for the experienced player with no griefing.

      <description>Start like single player mode. We allow full PvP for both players and buildings, but admins in game can eventually moderate players by using jail, kick, temporary ban... Mostly part of time, you are on your own to keep a exciting atmosphere. 

We are running Minecraft BETA on BUKKIT with the following plugins: 
LWC, Minequery, Stargate, Jail, Essentials, WorldEdit, WorldGuard, AfkKick, BorderGuard, Stats, Achievements, HeroChat, BigBrother, MyHome, AutoMessage, iConomy and SimpleMarket. 

Of course, we still improving to keep your fun up and running. Inadequate language and builds (harass, bulling, agressive, racist, sexual) are totally unacceptable. Please, visit www.lancernet.com.br/ffamcs for more info...</description>

      <name>Toyiz PVP | Nations | Griefing allowed! </name>
      <description>
Rules
1) Killing is allowed.
2) Griefing is allowed. ONLY IF it is done without hacked materials. Burning a building is legal.
3) Hacking is an immediate bannable offence. Don't even try it.
4) Begging an admin for a teleport, for items, or to become an admin yourself is extremely annoying and is kickable. Don't try it.
5) All players are to be treated EQUAL.
6) Griefing the spawn building, or attacking/killing ANYONE within the spawn building EVER...is bannable. Just don't do it.

Style
The server is meant to be played in teams. Teams offer protection and allow you to fight back if attacked.
Going solo is allowed, but is not recommended, as if you are killed or pillaged, you cannot ask anyone for help (Unless someone is willing to help you for a price, etc).
Literally play the game as you want to: Become a nation with other players, start a town or city, build a castle and become king, start a small shop and trade wares, become a hunter to get food and hides, become a rogue and steal from buildings and chests, become a raider and pillage and burn anything that can be set light to, become a hermit and live underground so no-one can find you.
Admins are players just like you. We earn everything legitimate, and only use our powers to kick, ban, and spawn items for the starting spawn areas.</description>

This is a small server I run in my apartment, obviously based in Toronto.  Right now I'm messing around with a few mods, running bukkit, factions, and a few others. 
It would be cool to have some locals to play with, but I welcome anybody who wants to play here.
No real rules just don't fuck with your neighbors, unless its a faction war :)
Right now there are just a handful of players it would be cool to have some more.

      <description>I gladly introduce a new survival multiplayer server that's meant for just that, survival! This server is hosted on Multiplay's rented servers, so virtually 100% uptime. Currently, it's just a small 8 slot server, but I will expand it as necessary.

Rules:
 This should be a no-brainer, no griefing. If you think you might be griefing, then you probably are, just use your better judgment and you should be fine.

 Respect admins and V.I.P.'s, they won't hesitate to report problematic players.

 Please avoid pillars or any other unsightly structures. If you MUST use them, please remove them as soon as you're done with them.

 No handouts. Everyone is responsible for themselves, don't ask for tools, teleports, none of that.</description>

      <description>Updated 4/8/11: This server is a lovely free build server, while we do offer you land to build a house in either one of our cities, you may go wherever you please. The server is protected by mods, and we have many backup folders just in case.

Admins have not been online much due to real life and other things, we made the server whitelisted so nobody could get on at that time. We are in search for a few admins to keep people in line, and who love to build and expand the server. Admins will have the ability to spawn themselves items so it will be easier to help expand the server and keep it in order.

COMING SOON: We should have many more mods coming soon to help people get started or who need extra stuff. We will be offering a building "rank" where you can just build without the need of getting the material. Lastly we will be opening our subway up to everyone once we have completed the city it will be going to, the subway is fully functional and only needs you to press one button to work! 

Hope to see you there, if you have questions and I (collinqt) am not online, you can email me at ehlers5132@gmail.com</description>

Minecraft Bukkit Server
IP: 80.95.150.131:25565
www.crafterkultur.de.vu

Hallo Freunde des gepflegten Kl&#246;tzchenbauens,
der Crafter Kultur Server er&#246;ffnet seine Pforten und hei&#223;t euch Herzlich Willkommen.
Auf euch wartet eine Webseite mit Infos, TeamSpeak Channels, ein umfassendes Forum und
eine wachsende Community. Das ganze nat&#252;rlich 24/7 mit 20 freien Slots.

Wenn Ihr bauen wollt, dann geht auf der Webseite ins Forum und stellt euch unter "Antr&#228;ge" vor.
Du wirst dann freigeschaltet f&#252;r den Rang "Spieler" auf dem Crafter Kultur Server.
Vergesst nicht die Regeln auf der Webseite zu lesen!!!

---

Philosophie / Features:

Crafter Kultur strebt ein leichtes Rollenspiel Setup an, so werden wir nach und nach den Server noch um weitere
Plugins erweitern. Beginne dein Leben in unserer Welt am Spawn und begib dich in die weite Welt zu Fuss oder per Monorail
und stecke dir dein eigenes Grundst&#252;ck ab.
Du kannst dich auch mit ein paar Leuten zusammentun und eine Stadt gr&#252;nden oder B&#252;rger einer Stadt werden.
Auch gr&#246;&#223;ere Spielerprojekte finden auf der gro&#223;en Karte seinen Platz. Steige in den R&#228;ngen auf dem Server auf und schalte somit
weitere Privilegien und Verantwortungen frei, werde z.B. vom normalen Spieler zum Crafter bef&#246;rdert.

Wir m&#246;chten mit unserem Server vor allem auch Architektur begeisterte ansprechen.
Ihr habt bei uns die Chance eure H&#228;user, Projekte, St&#228;dte und Bauwerke
im Forum von anderen bewerten zu lassen und der Gewinner wird w&#246;chentlich auf der Webseite gepostet und erh&#228;lt nat&#252;rlich
einen Preis in Form von Ingame Items.

Der Server ist in Entwicklung, werdet Teil von ihm und &#228;u&#223;ert Verbesserungsvorschl&#228;ge im Forum.
Wir freuen uns auf aktive und interessierte Mitspieler.

---

MODERATOREN GESUCHT:

Wir suchen momentan noch kompetente Moderatoren. Moderator ist der h&#246;chste erreichbare Rang auf dem Server und direkter Unterst&#252;tzer der Admins.
Mods bekommen viel Verantwortung und viele Rechte &#252;bertragen mit denen sie Gewissenhaft umgehen m&#252;ssen.
Hierf&#252;r suchen wir momentan noch 3 Leute.

Vorraussetzung:
- Mindestalter 20 Jahre
- genug Erfahrungen in Minecraft gesammelt
- Eventuell schon Admin, Mod etc. Erfahrung

- TeamSpeak3

Falls Ihr Interesse habt, meldet euch bei uns ganz normal als Spieler an und

      <description>NO WHITE LIST - 20 Slots
============================================================

Elaboration on the PVP here. Fuck shit up, raid anyone's base, get into it anyway possible, tnt, water, lava if you need to. Kill or be killed. You can break bricks, you can make towers to get into bases you can do what ever you want, as long as it doesn't go against the rules posted or what an admin says.

============================================================
Donating can help us keep this server up!

Any donation will give you VIP rank Permanently, and our eternal gratitude.

Donating $5 will give you access to one small chest in the bank at spawn, where only YOU can access.

Donating $10 you, and anyone else you want added will get access to a 15x15 block of land(all the way up and down) where only you and whom you choose can build. No chests will be allowed in these areas.
Just a note, these houses are purely aesthetic, meaning they have no use but to look nice.

For donating send it to holiestcow@hotmail.com on paypal. Make sure in the donation to put your minecraft name!

=============================================================
RULES

1: No Racism.
2: No Greifing(a given really)(let me re-literate, greifing on a pvp to me, means making swastikas or 1x1 towers to the sky. You can do anything to get into a base and wreck any base)
3: Dont camp the spawn to kill people.
4: No Swastikas or 1 unit wide 300 high towers.
5: No Hacking.
6: No Wire frame Texture packs.
7: Follow what an admin says.
8: Admins do what they want.

Note: Were a friendly community but on Minecraft you can do what you want to survive. </description>

      <name>The Pope's Pure Survival Server</name>
      <description>Fully survival / pvp server. Anything allowed by the game is allowed by the server. This means that if you build in the open without any protection, you WILL end up getting griefed. PreciousStones IS installed, so if you have the resources  to protect your creations, you can.

Other Stuff:
no '/warp', use '/warp point' and walk there with a compass.
'/man' is an index of ingame help docs. They are rather sparse, but anything not covered there can be looked up on the bukkit forums.</description>

      <description>NO RULES SERVER! 60 SLOTS!

The only protected area is a 1000x1000ish city you can buy plots to build a home in. Outside the city is a free for all!

No client side modifications that give you an unfair advantage (fly/speed/clear textures) or you will be banned indefinitely.
This (obviously) includes inventory editors and duping.

I should probably also note that the server runs quite a few plugins I developed myself to allow staff to monitor almost every aspect of the server. We ban a lot of people every day and you will be one of them if you try and break the rules. So rather than ruining other peoples fun and wasting our staffs time join us in the fun and follow the rules.

      <description>Server Features:

Player and Software based economy.
The in-game currency is "Pound". By using iConomy plugin, you can hire people to work for your or work for someone else to gain pounds. When you start have have lots of pounds, a whole new world of possibilities opens up. You can buy rare resources, port around the map using portals, get a vault, create a town or buy yourself a protected plot to build on!

Ability to create towns.
For 1500 pounds you can create a your own town! This will allow you to be the leader of a clan with its own chat and area. You will be able to join a nation or create one yourself. Joining a nation will allow you to participate in wars and gain lots of pounds in the event of victory. You can also gain more territories if a uncaring mayor settles to close to your borders!

Create dynamic or animated buildings.
Whith the plugin "Controller Block", you can create complex redstone circuits without having to care about distance. You can also toggle the presence of blocks, allowing you to create fence gates, blast doors, animations and even more!

Advanced circuitry chips functionality.
On our server, you have the possibility to create impressive circuitry by using signs chips. Here is a list of chips you can use : http://eisental.github.com/RedstoneChip ... index.html

Fully working nether portals.
On our servers, nether portals work just like in single player! Be ready for some hardcore gameplay in hell!

Other plugins:
-WorldGuard
-General
-Permission
-Netherworld


Rules
-You must build realistic structures
-Large Tunnels should have pillar
-No flying buildings or roads
-Your buildings must integrate with the landscape or they will be destroyed
-You must be mature
-Do not destroy people's propriety

Raiding:
Destroying everything or destroying blocks at random is NOT raiding. Stealing everything when people are not logged in is not raiding either.

All tho, if a city decides to to attack a smaller village and claim it as its own is a successful raid.Of course, expelling the villager and claiming their propriety is not. It is also tho possible to charge taxes for protection.

This is good for all cities except the ones that are deemed "Neutral" by the admins. In a neutral city, PVP is not allowed.

This server is now hosted on a large dedicated server! Please support us so we can keep the server running!

      <description>MCBuilder currently has AFK Kick set to kick anyone who is inactive for 5 minutes, so the server stays AFK free. Big Brother to monitor players and rollback any Grief attacks. Craft Book just because it has so many features, Cuboid, and WorldEdit along with WorldGuard for the same reasoning. We also include DS Mail so you can send mail to other users while they are offline. Also LeafDropper so we don't have random leaves floating in the air, and LWC to protect you from thieves. LLamaCraft to make certain items unuseable. MineCart Mania so that more advanced MineCart tracks can be built. And we run on hMod.</description>

If you're looking for a server that plays and looks just like single player without a lot of useless mods, this is the server for you!  Simple and fun, and it doesn't use a permissions system, anyone can build!
Its a new server we are still trying to work out the bugs and get a couple more features.

The host box has been able to support about 25 players, the cap is at 20 for now.

Specs:
AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 6000+ (2 CPUs), ~3.0GHz
Memory: 6144MB RAM
FIOS 125/25 Fibre Line

CraftBukkit b323
Plugins:
BorderGaurd Light
ControllerBlock
General
HelpPages
iChat
Multiverse (with Nether!)
NoCheat (Players in the Noob Class found flying will be banned)
Permissions
SignColors
Stackable (Lots of items allowed to stack from 1 - 512)
TreeHugger (If you cut down a whole forest, there will be no ugly floating leaves)
World Edit
World Guard
We have 3 worlds:

"world" - The default world is limited to 750 units in every direction from spawn. This new zone is designed for new players of the server to show off their building skills and epic survival abilities. When you have completed a dwelling using non low level materials (smooth stone,stone tiles, glass, wood detailing), place a sign on the door, and respond to this thread with your name. If your construction is deemed acceptable, you will be promoted to the rank of Player. Upon promotion, you can use the Multiverse commands /mvtp, /mvlist and MV spawns. To enter the Player world, type /mvtp pworld.

"pworld" - The players world, where all of the main server population will be allowed to dwell. This world is 1500 units in every direction from spawn. The main City will be built here. No open pits, no ugly 1 material buildings. Griefers of this world will be demoted to default if they are trouble.

"nether" - Denizens of pworld may use /mvtp nether to travel into hell to collect its rich gooey in-nerds.

We have intermittent downtimes, sometimes for days, this is until the fiber hookup into the building is moved to a different area.</description>

&lt;font size ="4"&gt;&lt;center&gt;Tired of doing what admins tell you?&lt;center&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;font size ="3"&gt;Rampage Minecraft was created simply because there is no other server that filled our needs. And what are those needs? Absolutely nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Every other server you find will have you work on their castle, beg for items, or beg for build rights. At Rampage Minecraft, we don't do that. We let you run free throughout the world with 25 other people. You are free to grief, be griefed, pvp, or build up your defenses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

What does this mean for your gameplay? &lt;b&gt;Community&lt;/b&gt;. This no-rules system allows you to &lt;b&gt;form alliances&lt;/b&gt; with people to defend your homes against those attacking it. Feel free to start an entire economy and take on roles. Do whatever you wish and simply &lt;b&gt;HAVE FUN&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Minecraft is a sandbox game, it is not about conforming to admins and rules. Come to Rampage Minecraft and do what &lt;b&gt;YOU WANT&lt;/b&gt; :)&lt;/font&gt;</description>

But to be able to retrieve your build right, you most come in between 3:30 to around 9 or 10 PM, OR send me your Minecraft username to mbtfootball@yahoo.com. Until I assign your rights,  you won't be able to do anything.  The only rules to the server are build upon your own land, don't touch anyone else's stuff w/out permission. And, don't be a dick. Assholes will be kicked or banned temporarily, multiple offenders and/or trolls will be permabanned. </description>

      <name>Midgard - A Minecraft Realm</name>
      <description>A Bukkit server Based in London, UK.

Very active community with mumble voice chat looks for new players to venture into the world of Midgard! 

Features:

We've recently moved to bukkit, so the world is looking pretty fresh. We've incorporated mcMMO, which brings RPG elements to the game, allowing you to level up certain skills, such as herbalism, mining or archery as well as use anvils to repair tools and armor!

Towny allows you to form towns and nations, which can go to war against each other at specified times and allow for protected individual resident plots in towns. 

Runecraft for creating teleporters and waypoints.

Complete antigriefing package, we can rollback any changes made by griefers (not that we get a lot, the whitelist keeps most at bay)

In-game economy using iConomy, with the ability for players to create their own automated shops.

Plus a few other random bits and bobs like chest protection, deathchests, and buried treasure!

Check us out at our website and head to the forums to apply for the whitelist!</description>

City World is a place where players are encouraged to enjoy the sights and expand the city into new territory. If you would like buildrights for this and my other servers (the azakia worlds community) please register an account on our website. AzakiaWorlds.com
 ..

..

There are very few mods installed, and so this is a build-things-from-scratch server. You can however trade with other players or admins who can supply some materials. Both friendly and hostile mobs are turned on, however creeper explosions are off to protect the city. Above ground, the wold is set to perpetual day, causing mobs only to spawn underground or in the dark, and allowing for easier city-building.
 ..

..

Rules of the server include a ban on "Griefing", acquiring TNT, and the use of fire starting devices such as flint/steel and lava-buckets. Player killing and destruction of or unwanted addition to other people's creations are not allowed and covered in the no-griefing rule.

If you would like to join our server please go to our website, click on the link on the home page that will take you to the whitelist applications and please read the "Whitelist Application Formatting" and answer the questions in the "Whitelist Applications" section.
A few specs about our server is:
- Running on a home computer with 2GB Ram (1024MB/1GB Dedicated to the server), 320GB HDD, 2.6Ghz. As you can see this is a very little amount of RAM for a server to run properly so if anyone can help please leave a comment on the forums.
- We are a whitelist server meaning that only registered user's may join the server.
Please come join and have a great time!</description>

      <name>Spacemuff's 24/7 Teamwork Survival --Be epic--</name>
      <description>Oh you didn't know?  I've been running a dedicated 24/7 teamwork survival server with NO WHITELIST for almost 6 months.  It has been a great learning experience and I'm proud to say throughout that time we've had a great group of regulars and always welcomed many new people to our world and community.

Amazing times...

But now, we just started a NEW WORLD (February 25, 2011)... warping to our old worlds and to nether is enabled (but only once we build our first portal).  Most action will probably occur in this new main world because the terrain is so beautiful.

Come join our community.  Our motto: survive together and be epic.

This server is for teamwork survival... this means we help each other, but there is no /home or /spawn or teleporting-to-safety or item-spawning. Everything is pure effort; we are masochists... PVP against unwilling people is not allowed; this is a building and teamwork server... we have /lwc for locking your chests, furnaces, dispensers, signs, and doors..... you may dig and build as you wish, just not on others' work (please don't leave floating trees). all skill levels are welcome.

we try to create the default singleplayer minecraft experience, just with more people!

I have to go now; a spider is climbing the walls!

      <description>Der MeinCraft.EU-Server

Wir sind eine deutschsprachige Spielergemeinschaft (Community) und suchen nette Spieler die Spass am Bauen haben.

Um Baurechte zu erhalten, musst du dich zun&#228;chst im Forum registrieren. Danach lies bitte die Regeln und schreibe in den daf&#252;r vorgesehenen Bereich, dass du die Regeln gelesen hast und damit einverstanden bist.

Der MineCraft-EU-Server ist ein vorwiegend bauorientierter Server in dem bis auf wenige Aussnahmen, alle Spielelemente zur Verf&#252;gung stehen. Obwohl Rollenspiel eine untergeordnete Bedeutung hat, bieten wir ein sobald die Plugins daf&#252;r fertig sind ein Shopsystem, Quests und Events und nat&#252;rlich Monster an. Demnach ist das Gesundheits-/Schadensystem aktiviert. Allerdings erh&#228;lst du keinen Schaden, wenn du f&#228;llst, noch machen Creeper Schaden an Geb&#228;uden. Dies erm&#246;glicht, dass du in Ruhe bauen kannst. PVP ist abgeschaltet und auf Wunsch kann ein Modrator die Nacht auch mal zum Tag machen.

Das MeinCraft.EU-Team freut sich darauf, dich kennen zu lernen :-)

      <name>Pawncraft [UK][RPG][24/7][Guest-Zone][Vanilla]</name>
      <description>Pawncraft is an RPG-style server. We have many plugins running, to both ensure that the server is grief-free (Well, not technically grief-free, but we're able to find griefers as soon as you/we find a griefed spot and rollback their damages). Of course, we also have plugins that provide you more features in the game, such as portals, for easy travelling (We also have portals to the Nether!), mounts, because, who doesn't want to ride something? And of course, levels, which include woodcutting, mining, archery, repairing and much much more.

So if you think you like the sound of this server and love playing RPG's, come check out pawncraft.co.uk. You will be limited to building in the guest zone (But can still travel around and have all the commands/abilities members have), but by submitting an easy to fill out application at our website (http://pawncraft.co.uk) you can become a member and have access to build anywhere you want.

Note:

You cannot spawn items in this server. Griefing is not tolerated. For a list of rules, check this thread: http://pawncraft.co.uk/forums/index.php?topic=18.0

The server has a lot of plugins and thus has quite a learning curve. Please read the server information section of our forum for information on commands and rules. </description>

      <description>Our sever is a privately owned server that has seen the hubris and redundancy of other servers.
We offer another, a better, alternative for players who simply want to do what they are good at; for those who want to build with friends whom they can trust. Truly vanilla at its finest giving the ultimate survival experience. We only accept the most mature, the most competent and best players which we can find. So, apply and be among others who are serious about Minecraft. We have a goal of building the largest of everything, we only accept mature, friendly, dedicated, and skilled players. There's no limit to the building ability (except the sky).</description>

      <description>This server has 3 main worlds, 2 of which are cut off to only VIP and up. 
To build, you have to be in the Guest world. That world can be reached by typing "/mvtp guest".
The majority of players here are from Brikwars.com fourms, or from [UBA] and partner Steam clans.
The only way to get VIP rank or above is by donating $5 to the server.

      <description>Scoundreltopia is an RPG-style server. There is no 'freebuild', everything is found by the players themselves. We've got an economy (that we share with HoppyCraft), town zoning, dynamic monster spawning, and much more! Outside of town walls lurks many evils. Adventurers beware, in this world creepers are known to travel in small packs!

NETHER WORKS. However, marked chunks will be deleted every week to allow for new minerals to spawn on the map, and to allow minerals to repopulate the area. WE DON'T RESET. /item spawning is public, and we encourage building. Monsters &amp; Mobs are enabled.

      <description>A new server just setup but hopefully, with your help, we will make a really good server! It is a free build server and you can basically build whatever you like (even cities or civilizations.)  It also has a whitelist so just apply in the comments section below and i will look over them every day or so. It is quite a small server right now  Max Players on at one time is 8. Oh almost forgot, the server will usually be up GMT time from about 7 to 9 in the morning, then about 4 to 10 in the evening,but on the weekends, or school holidays, it will probably be up all day long, if not then i've either forgot to put it up or im too busy.

      <description> Hello !!!  
I've make this topic to tell you that a new minecraft server is open to public, called server "Joke".


 What can we do ingame ?   


This server contain some really big plugins:

Bukkit server.

Runecraft = Possibility to create magic runes and to use it for fly, create a little house...
Authorize = Security accounts
War = Pvp system two team, diamond and gold
McMmo = put rpg leveling and more
EekRunes = Like runecraft mod, create runes and do magic


 Rules And Gameplay   


Rules are simple: -Leveling skills 

-City construction participation (build your house in town)

-Pvp fighting participation in Area Tournament

-NO CHEATING ! Server Protected

PS: Rules will be updated.

So the game is based on a constant pvp fighting with other players, with a safe zone to create your house (more town soon =&gt; it depend of number of players). After all this, you can do anything you want, create alliance, mafia...etc. There're two team and one step of construction and another step of battle ! Capture the flag mod.

We are currently relatively small, which on the good side means that we have no need for purposely over-ly complicated politics, and you can just play the game.  Only rule.. don't grief, and don't PVP inside of "Built" areas, which is to say don't kill someone collecting wood, don't kill someone in the city, and don't kill inside man-created places.  Besides that, have fun, build big!</description>

      <description>Mob Wars - Defeat The Mobs
    

Hi, this server is for people who want to fight the WAR against the mobs.
I bet all of you have been blown up by a creeper at least once.
If they didn't blow you up maybe they blew up your creations.
(This wont happen if you played on "Peaceful" LOL)
Well go into the server grab a sword in the spawn's chest all full with iron swords take one or two, 
but don't take them all!
But if theres no more swords well restock them don't worry. 
In case we do run out of swords, you can just dig a hole in the ground and cover yourself until the night is gone.
Do you want to defeat all the monsters? Come to this server!

Go to our youtube to see if the servers up or not.

Don't go too far away because you might get blown up by creepers and
start at spawn not knowing where your house is.

PLEASE DON'T GRIEF 
I know what its like. When i bought minecraft I went on a server
built a house here comes someone lalalalala he starts killing my house. 
I was so sad. D:

      <name>EmpireBattles Colonization Server--iConomy, Stargates, NPC's, homes, chest protection, and MORE!</name>
      <description>The EmpireBattles colonization server is a server that aims to provide the best experience in Minecraft SMP. The object of this server, is to expand civilization and the capital across the entire map[-3000 to 3000]. As we expand, you can make money, buy plots of land in the city borders, or even start your own city in the wild! Its all up up to you! 

&lt;br&gt;
Also, for ease of access and remembering, you can now use the address: 'mc1.empirebattles.com'  to connect!
&lt;br&gt;

There will also be special events held at certain times, such as hunts, bounty-fests, maze contests, and much more!

~::NOTICE::~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;
You MUST read the rules on our site in order to gain access to the world. This is not a whitelisted world, but we also expect our players to adhere to a certain level of decency and understanding of the systems.&lt;br&gt;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are running several mods that help enhance gameplay, and interest on the server:

    * iConomy~This plugin allows the use of a digital currency, or in-game money. We use this to buy and sell materials, land, and different in-game objects.
    * WorldEdit &amp; WorldGuard~These plugins allow for us to easily modify the land, and protect things from griefers, and give you control over YOUR stuff!
    * AfkBooter~Tired of people collecting resources or money just by standing there, AFK, all day? Well, worry no more! AfkBooter will kick users who dont do anything in game!
    * Citizens~Want your own NPC to dress? Have talk to guests? Run your shop? This plugin lets that happen!
    * Craftbook~Its craftbook! Just google it :D
    * Dynmap~A full online viewing of the live map, with our players !
    * HelpPages~A more organized /help function, with more customizable help!
    * LocalShops~A plugin that runs the server shops for users to stock up on lots of materials!
    * MeasuringTape~Need percise dimensions? Use a string to measure!
    * nSpleef~Adds the fun game of Spleef to the world!
    * Philosopher'sBox~Dont incinerate those useless blcoks! Turn them into something more useful!
    * PropperTime~Due to popular demand, we use this plugin to make day progress at only 30% its normal speed!
    * TeleConfirmLite~Need to get to a friend, but dont want to walk? This plugin allows users to teleport to eachother!
    * iConomyChestShops~This plugin allows all users to have their very own shop to buy and sell stuff with other players!
    * HeroBounty~This is a plugin that allows you to use your digital currency from iConomy and place a bounty on someone's head, to get them hunted by other players.
    * MonsterHunt~We dont like having to hide at night while the mobs come out. So, with MonsterHunt, you can 'register' for the nightly hunt, kill monsters all night, and whoever has the most kills in the morning, gets a prize! (this is only activated by admins for special events)
    * HeroChat~This plugin is extremely useful for control over the chat, through channels, banning, and most importantly, color!
    * Jail~This plugin allows us to easily jail users in multiple locations for set periods of time, if they have committed a crime against the server.
    * BorderGuard~This plugin limits our world so that everything stays very close together.
    * Stargates~Travel far via obsidion portals to get to key points on the map! 

If you have any questions about the different systems we have, please post in the forums, or ask one of our support people.</description>

      <name>YourCraft [SURVIVAL SERVER] No bukkit YET!</name>
      <description>It's a newly started server, so don't expect too much already:)

There will be added mods!

It's basically a survival server for normal people like you and me, who wants to build (hopefully) crazy constructions, and have a good time with other players. The server is not bukkit, but i will try to move it all to bukkit as soon as i can:)

Please don't judge the server just by looking at it for 5 seconds, i'm not an expert, but i will do my best to get some good admins and moderators to look after everything.

I will (as i said before) add some mods in the future, just wait:)

Hope you wanna settle down on my little server:)</description>

      <description>This server is a straight-up survival server, where you can help people, trade, survive, and make allys. -It restarts every hour, (saves everything) and is on 12 hours a day. 
-There are almost no rules aside from the basics such as no griefing, no stealing, ect.
- All in all this server has a developing city and I look forward to seeing it grow in population.
The server is slightly laggy, so turn your view distance to normal, or small. </description>

      <name>The Biscuit Higgins experiment!&lt;new!&gt;&lt;build with Biscuit!&gt;</name>
      <description>Biscuit Higgins is a peace loving man.  As a famed retired NHL Goalie, he understands the necessity of teamwork and maturity both on the ice and in the mines.  Although lighthearted and humorous, Biscuit holds dear both his beloved minecraft blocks and the security and enjoyment of his fellow players who co-inhabit his cubical world.  Biscuit, in his retirement has taken to collecting myriad jigsaw puzzles,linux distribution and above all hosting his own minecraft server with the help of his Grandsons.  Biscuit's aim is to have his "experiment" as he calls it be shared,populated and changed by a small community of mature, respectful, open and loving minecrafters.  Biscuit is tired of grief.  Biscuit is tired of abuse. Biscuit wants to have fun with like-minded players who will join him in any zany idea he and his grandsons can think of in his current Survival Mode/Freebuild/Adventure server.  Dedicated players will be rewarded with the ability to help decide what happens to the experiment.
Will you join Biscuit's experiment?  *Leave a brief description of your play style and why you'd like to join us*  Limited space.</description>

&lt;img src='http://www.epidcraft.de/images/Epidcraft.png'/&gt;

Momentan liegt das meiste Interesse im Spiel Minecraft, weshalb wir uns dazu entschieden haben, einen eigenen Server auf zu bauen. 
Falls jemand lust hat, mit uns zusammen zu bauen und die Welt zu entdecken, kann dieser jene welche sich gerne melden!
Da der Server &#252;ber eine Whitelist l&#228;uft, muss sich nat&#252;rlich beworben werden. Dazu einfach auf unsere Homepage schauen und im TS&#179; vorstellen. Da wir so eine bestimmte Gruppe von Spielern (Griefer usw...)  versuchen von unseren Server fernzuhalten, bekommt jeder neue User sofort Baurechte!
Die Welt wird momentan alle 5 Minuten automatisch gespeichert!

      <description>This is a kid friendly server. Consider it pg. No swearing, giant penis in the sky, etc.
If you can't be helpful, instead of being a jerk to the younger players, just stay out.
PLAYERS WHO CANNOT READ AND FOLLOW SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS WILL STAY IN THE "guest area" as a guest.
Generic rules apply. No griefing. no stealing. etc.
Build/mine far away from other people.
If you're ever caught asking a player for personal information, you will be banned.

Creepers don't damage blocks.

You will join as a guest. You WILL be able to build and mine as a guest. But some things will be disabled.

      <description>- Server Introduction -

Welcome to ~AtomicServer~! I'm going to keep this short and not bore you with a 30 page introduction. Our server is simple and fun. We use bukkit for basic protection, however we removed most commands from all mods. We have the ability to keep the server safe and fun, and that's about it. We like to work together to create many monumental buildings and cities. We also work for everything we build, no item spawning. We also have designated a PVP area and even bumper boats! Lol, anyway follow the rules, and come have fun with us! This server is hosted and private. Please apply below and I will send you a message when your on the whitelist.

We do keep hourly backups for a week of the server so information will never be lost.

Failure to follow rules may be grounds for you to be banned immediately.

- Plugins -

Bukkit - Needed for plugins, limited.
Permissions - Ranks.
NoCheat - Obvious.
GuestPrev - Prevents Guests from building/griefing.
Magic Carpet - Quick Admin Movement.
Multiverse - Added a netherworld to our server.
BorderGuard - 1,500 x 1,500 map and we can expand this out at a later time.
LWC - Chest and inventory protection system.

- Rules -

1. DO NOT GRIEF! ZERO TOLERANCE...
2. RESPECT EVERYONE
3. Start Building 40 Blocks from Spawn
4. No 1x1 Towers
5. No 1x1 Shafts
6. No TNT/Flint&amp;Steel
7. be chill :P

No item spawning, ever, everything here has and will be earned. Please don't bug the admin/mods/owner for gifts or handouts.</description>

      <description>Seeing so many servers with custom mods and other modifications I wanted to create a server as close to single-player experience as posible. The map is random and gameplay is pure vanilla. Yet you can still cooperate, build something together and have lots of fun with other people (I hope). So ditch that lonely singleplayer mode and join! Keep in mind that any form of griefing is still prohibited. Incremental backups are run every hour, full backups on daily basis, rotated weekly. Cartography is run every hour.</description>

We are some relaxed minecraft players who just love to have fun and play minecraft. We are still in beta and alot will be changed and added so feel free to just come in and check us out. When you first log in you should start gathering supplies to start a town and maybe even a nation because you cant build on someone unless its your land and will be plenty for everyone. As more people log in and start playing there will be town and nation wars where winners get prices and even more land to build on. You can also sell things in ur inventory if you want to.

As i would like to get a name list on everyone on the server so please leave your name in a post below so i can add you to the members list. and also please put if you would like to have teamspeak or not.

[Teal] [Teal] [Teal] How to get started [Teal] [Teal] [Teal]

so since this is a towny based server to get started you need to know that you cant build anywhere until you make a town or join a town.if you want to join a town just ask around in chat and you should be able to find one but if you want to make a town you need to find a place that says wilderness and is not around any other towns by putting /towny map and if it all says wilderness that means your ok to build but if someones elses land is there that means dont build because later on in town wars you will be fighting the same person the whole time.

[stone] [stone] [stone] Making a town [stone] [stone] [stone]

after you get that done above you must put in /town new (town name with no spaces) (your name) then you have your first town. Note monsters cant spawn in towns. now you can build within that first lot or you can claim some more land by doing /town claim to claim the wilderness your standing on or do /resident set mode map townclaim. what that does is enable you to claim as you walk and it auto moves the map along with you so you can tell where you are in the map. to turn that off again do /resident set mode reset reset . and all that does is reset the modes to normal.

[Spider] [Spider] [Spider] Some commands [Spider] [Spider] [Spider]

some starter commands are
/help tells you a list of some simple commands
/towny tells you a list of some towny commands
/lwc tells you a list of chest locking and unlocking commands
/sethome sets your home
/home teles you home
/town shows you your towns status

      <name>KiteCraft - Mature Mining</name>
      <description>Visit us online at http://mining.kitecraft.net

KiteCraft is a new server that hopes to provide the most well rounded Minecraft experience online. The server is only open to mature players (from young adults to old folks) who understand how to respect other players and their work. If you aren&#8217;t mature enough to understand and follow the server rules found on our website, don't bother logging on. There are plenty of open servers out there that would better suit your needs.

We offer a stable CraftBukkit server with the latest protective plugins to keep grief out. The 24/7 server should always have 100% up-time, but does have 2 daily automated restart to increase stability. We also backup the entire server 4 times a day to keep your work safe and run an hourly world save. The world is new and open to anyone to visit, but build rights are restricted to only those who prove they both know and understand the server rules listed on the website. Anyone stopping in the server just to cause trouble will be wasting their time and have all of their changes reverted even if they've been building/griefing for several days. Violations of the rules will result in a kick or ban based on severity. Appeals will be accepted but must pass a thorough investigation into the incident. ALL changes to the server are logged.

Through a lot of trials we were able to hand select a specific style of world. KiteCraft is locked at 5,000 by 5,000 blocks with spawn situated at 0&#215;0 for an easy understanding of your location and how far you can travel. The Nether is no longer open so we've included nether drops to the normal world. On percentage basis, nether blocks drop randomly from like block types: Netherrack from cobble and stone, soulsand from dirt, and glowstone blocks from redstone ore. Players are free to explore and build in almost any location (a 100 block area surrounding spawn is restricted to the server owner) and you can pick your spot by either exploring in game or using the maps posted on our website. Our site also contains the latest news and information about the server with a regularly updated list of available in game commands and an area for players to post suggestion and concerns.

There is no white-list, but your enjoyment is our number one concern so build rights are locked upon entry and can only be granted by a server admin or one of the moderators. PVP is locked to PVP areas, TNT and Creeper explosions are disabled but you can build with TNT blocks if you make them. Fire spread (both player and environmental) is disabled but anyone can light fires if they like. Remember, all player actions are logged. We have also disabled fall damage due to the type of terrain we have chosen for the world map. We run LWC so that players can lock their chests and BigBrother so griefers can be caught and dealt with quickly.

Our players shouldn&#8217;t care about who has the most diamonds or who built their house out of gold blocks. This server is about having a good time online in a real survival server. We do not and will not generate blocks or items for players. If you lose your gear in lava while out caving, you&#8217;ll just have to get back out there and work to get it back. Your structures and the things you own will be earned by the work you put in while you&#8217;re online. Team up or go it alone, it&#8217;s all about how you want to play the game.

For added fun and a great way to take a break we also run MobRider and offer free saddles near spawn. If you haven&#8217;t tried out this plugin, you don&#8217;t know what fun in minecraft really is.

If you would like to give us a shot, just jump on and take a look around. All players must read the server rules at mining.kitecraft.net before they will gain build rights.</description>

world is beautiful, and BACKED UP

We are a small SMP + freebuild server with one architecturally amazing world that was custom generated EG: bedrock is now obsidian, the is a lot more coal than normal etc etc. we have a small in game economy with its own stock market that changes the prices to stop people flooding the markets :P we also have a job market in the Job Center where users can use the money they have accumulated and pay someone a fee to do a job. We do operate a build list, as greifers do seem to find it irresistible, good news is we have BigBrother to watch over all your creations and hard work. Basically nothing i say here will be anywhere near as good as the impression you'd get from the server itself, so feel free to come on in as a guest, maybe you'd then just want to stay as a member :)

A dedicated server with friendly admins and a few helpful mods (bukkit and custom plugins to enhance gameplay). Being a vanilla server, hacking and cheating are not tolerated and neither is obvious griefing.</description>

      <name>EVL Gaming City/Guild/RPG Survival Mob/swarms on weekends build on weekdays economy</name>
      <description>EVL Gaming's city/guild survival server. During the week you have the ability to buy many different types of items, use the bank, or the community chest. 

We do not use warps, instead we have a central minecart line, with stations that branch off to each city.

To apply visit evlgaming.com/war and apply to one of the city's. Then the mayor will add you as a resident and you will be given some tools and some commands. You may join the server without doing this but you won't have any commands.

      <description>[**] -Very- new Bukkit SMP server. Hoping to gather a small, peaceful community who don't blare rap music on their note blocks all night long.(Server will not accept any more than 20 players at a time.) 

[**]Currently using the entire Essentials package, MobRider, sethome, LWC (Chest protection), Multiworld (FULLY functional Nether), area protection, an improved chat system (broadcasts, colored names, private messages), and soon to come when we become a bit more populated: Towny and iConomy. 


[**]We do not allow PvP or griefing. PvP is on a consent-only basis. All block interaction is logged, any and all grief activity will result in a ban on your part. Then we'll find your mom and punch her in the ovaries. But no, srsly. We have section rollbacks so anything you do will be reversed in a few minutes. 


[**]This server is running a whitelist. You're free to connect and wander around but you cannot edit until approved. Please apply by emailing your response to the following questions to easyshade29@gmail.com: 


-Your ingame name? 

-How long have you been an owner of Minecraft? 

-Are you a peaceful player who can get along well with an equally peaceful community? 

-Do you agree to never grief another player or otherwise intentionally inflict harm on their being? 

-What's your favorite band/musical artist? </description>

      <name>WaterCraft [Bukkit/Professions/Economy/RPG-Elements]</name>
      <description>Ever been interested in playing in a world completely covered in water? Love wooden ships, bridges, and houses? This is the place for you! What we're trying to do is make a sort-of "Waterworld" type SMP experience. Please remember, this server is geared more towards mature players. Any age is welcome, but don't be annoying.

Current Features:

- Mobs are on!
- Extra commands (/afk, /who, /compass, etc.)
- Set your home/spawn, as well as invite friends into your home without making them walk!
- Fishing is now useful! Not only do you catch fish, you can also catch materials, animals, armor, mobs, and more!
- RPG-like leveling/skills system, increase your level, increase your abilities! Including mining, unarmed, acrobatics, archery, and more!
- Stargates for quickly getting from town to town.
- Drawbridges, simple elevators, opening+closing gates, switchable lights, etc.
- Chest/door protection! Don't let them into your chests, or simply into your home!
- Full economy and shop systems. Buy materials, weapons, houses, towns, and more with your Rupees!
- Anti-griefing protection.
- Complex and fully featured elevators, you can even add opening glass doors!
- PVP arenas with tournaments and prizes!
- More to come!

Professions:

Work your way up and become a Trader, Fighter, or Builder to make extra Rupees and gain more resources. All with their own exclusive perks and abilities.

Rules:

- NO GRIEFING! Griefing = Immediate permanent ban. Don't be an asshole.
- NO STEALING! Same as above ^.
- NO RACISM! Swearing is fine, as I've stated, this server is geared more towards adults/mature people, so say whatever, as long as there is no racist comments or offending racial slurs. If you're offended by swearing, don't join the server.
- TNT/Fire is not allowed. It's been blocked anways, but just incase anybody was wondering.
- BE RESPECTFUL! Respect everyone, treat everyone nice. This server is meant for fun people to have fun, if you don't get along with somebody, tell them to fuck off (or just ignore them). After that, ignore and leave them alone. We're all just trying to enjoy the game, which is EXACTLY what it is, a game.
- DON'T BE ANNOYING No, I won't op you. And no, I won't spawn items for you. So don't ask. Asking me lets me know you obviously didn't read these rules, and that makes a bad first impression.
- NO MOB SPAWN TRAPS! - Any type of mob spawn trap is forbidden. Any user caught making/using/having built one will be banned.
- NO 1x1 Towers - If you need help building and have to stack some blocks up, that's fine. But DELETE them afterwards please. Same goes with underwater. Just because we can't see them doesn't mean it doesn't add unnecessary server-usage.
- NO HACKS! - Speed hack, flying hack, etc. are NOT ALLOWED period. Using these will get you banned.
- Report any player breaking these rules! If you see a player breaking any of these rules, or just doing something you feel they shouldn't be, take a screenshot (if you can), get their IGN, and PM me the info.</description>

      <description>Newly created server with a few dedicated players. build what you want where you want. we're using towny, permissions, craftbook and essentials and a few other plug-ins. 

we have helpful admins don't hesitate to ask anything. save for the fact that we will not give items to those who nag and complain about not getting anything. homepage will be up as soon as possible. 

And whitelisting might be enlisted. that is a future battle though. 

join us, have fun and be kind. 

read the rules as you come.

before I forget. we have a Teamspeak channel as well.
channel ts.fragnet.net
port : 10033

Build where ever you like, within reason, and don't harp on the other players, and you're set.


Rules:
- No speed/texture hacking (minimaps, clients, etc are fine)
- No TNT
- No Grief

Appeal bans: shank@shankshock.com

Did I mention how we have a custom client, that enables cloaks and Deadmau5 ears for donators, as well as a few niche bug fixes and the like? All the more reason to come and try it!</description>

      <description>Hey! :D

On Danish Minecraft Server, the main language is Danish, but other languages are welcome. Everyone can build on the server, and the we play the survival way which means you have to get materials yourself. We have a Voice Server that you can join, too. We also have a site where you will find information about the Voice Server, the rules, donating to the server, and  a lot of other stuff coming up.

(Note: We're currently looking for a better name for the server and website, so suggestions are welcome)

      <name>Oblivion [Hardcore/Deathban][PvP/Survival]</name>
      <description>The Oblivion PvP [Hardcore/DeathBan] server is now online! Join us now at: 206.217.129.123 / oblivion.jestservers.com

Server is hosted in the US -- New York, specifically. 


From the moment you leave the spawn, you will find yourself immersed in a world that requires you to fend for yourself. Whether it be against monsters or other players, you'll have to fight to survive. Create alliances or fight your way to glory alone, build bases or a village, wage wars and most of all, have fun!

Gear up as fast as possible to join the fight, or perhaps hoard your plundered loot and treasures and hide. Be cautious should you decide to trade with another player, as they may backstab you at any time!

The satisfaction of a DeathBan PvP server is derived from knowing when you kill someone, you've banned them from the server for a select period of time. On top of this, any loot that you may acquire is that much more important to keep and defend within the confines of your hideout. Create your legacy and cherish what you've amounted to, as you have done so with the knowledge that all could be lost.

No items will be granted, there are no free teleports, no admin/mod assistance unless griefers/dupers/hackers have been spotted. If you are able to catch someone doing any three, screenshot/fraps it and send me a PM.


Rules:
&#8226; Items can be stolen from anyone, by anyone.
&#8226; Players can get killed by others and have their items looted.
&#8226; DeathBan is currently set to 30 minutes.
&#8226; Traps are allowed.
&#8226; Base griefing is allowed.
&#8226; Do not aimlessly start forest fires.
&#8226; Do not camp spawn.
&#8226; Do not spam.
&#8226; Do not hack.
&#8226; Do not dupe items.

Plug-ins:
The Oblivion server runs the following plug-ins:
&#8226; WorldGuard
&#8226; WorldEdit
&#8226; iZone
&#8226; DeathBan
&#8226; Informant
&#8226; Variatree (apples have a small percentage to drop from trees)</description>

      <name>G's Dimension</name>
      <description>Graloth's Dimension started as a lan server hosted on my local computer, the same that I play on. However soon it turned out that more than just a couple of IRL friends were interested in joining the server, and thus we decided to open it for others, but on a strictly invite-only basis. Since then the playerbase has grown from a mere 3 to 8, and the server itself as migrated from my local machine over to a dedicated Mac Mini server, bought for this purpose alone. This allows us to be flexible when it comes to how many we would like to have on our server, even though it is currently set to a max of 12, raising the limit wont be a problem once we reach the current limit.

We strive to be friendly, helpful and respectful towards all our players, but also realize that everyone can have a bad day, and just not feel like chatting, we expect all our players to strive for that as well.

We also have a dedicated ventrilo server, which all our players are allowed to use, even outside minecraft.</description>

      <name>The TNT Server</name>
      <description>Building is great and all.. But sometimes you just want a bit more. In this server you get TNT to blow the landscape to smithereens with.

Type these commands:
"/kit TNT" for 64 TNT
"/kit torches" for 64 Torches
"/kit goods" for all everything diamond and a compass

Monsters and other critters are turned on and you auto heal if injured. You can play normally and build stuff, but please don't expect it to last very long!

As a side note: To keep the server from exploding from all the TNT I've set a delay to the /kit TNT command. You can only use it once every 10 minutes. I might either lower the delay or increase the amount of TNT given if things go well.</description>

We would like to play the game as close to SMP as possible. Though there are some added game play mechanics such as warp points, town zones and an in-game economy using shops.
Mods types installed:
Economy
Warp points
Nether
Anti-Grief
Town zones
Global Banning

Come join us and play on our public server!

It is our goal to maintain a diverse and mature community to enjoy the game with together. We run Bukkit on Omnicraft along with a host of plugins to improve gameplay and to cut down on griefers. While this is a legit server, there is an economy to make certain items more easily accessible (like diamond).

      <description>Hey guys,

I decided to make a server that I've always wanted in Minecraft. A true survival server. Not just any old server where people build, but a server with monster's on and you have to survive. No fancy money but a few helpful commands only for the purpose of anti grief and stealing. 

Once logged in:

You spawn on an island called 'spawn island'. Once there you can pick up freebies to help you from the trees. You'll see signs. From then on it's up to you where and what you do (as long as it's not griefing, read the rules!). Please dont all huddle up, I've changed the spawn for a reason. Thanks, and good luck!

http://amphicraft.tumblr.com for more information and news.

VIPS: 

Donating is very much apreciated. It help's me pay for the server and to upgrade if we get a lot of income (all money made goes to the server) so we can expand more. If you do feel you want to donate, it's a minimum of &#163;5 and you'll get the [VIP] rank which you can show off and also commands that other players dont. 

Examples of some commands: Warping, teleporting, 1 free fully protected area, your own insured vault, kits and some other things.

Current plugins:

- MMOSkills (It just adds levels in to the game, just to add more fun. It doesn't limit what you can do)
- Minecart Mania (Adds for minecart features as I dont like the default minecarts)
- WorldGaurd (World protection, anti griefing, ect)
- WorldEdit (Polygon editing)
- TreeApples (Trees drop apples [rare])
- BigCatch (Adds more to the fishing skill, you can catch old boots all the way to a skeleton [rare])
- Chest/Door Protection (Adds protection to chests and doors)

Feel free to join, it's a small server 15max due to I'm funding it myself. Please read the rules when and if you enter. I'm very strict on them, if you can keep to them then your all set in my books.

This is not a white-list, subject to change if people greif, ect.

This server is now whitelisted

      <name>Boss Server</name>
      <description>BossServer is a new server hosted in the US

Server Address: jinivus.com
Server port: 25565

Why chose BossServer?

    * 99.9% Uptime - The only time the server is down is during updates
    * No lag - Lag is bad in any situation, and we've done everything within our power to get rid of it.
    * No Whitelist - We believe a server should be simple to access, for that reason we have decided against whitelisting.
    * Hourly backups - Backups ensure that your house remains intact no matter what kind of disaster befalls it.
    * Bukkit Mod - Bukkit is up and coming server mod that will replace hMod, it allows many plugins so that we can tune our server to the players needs
    * LWC plugin - LWC allows players to lock chests, doors, furnaces and even signs, extremely configureable, whats not to love?
    * (TEMPORARILY DISABLED)War plugin - War plugin is a beta plugin which gives Minecraft Warzones(Very similar to battlegrounds in WoW). We are trialing the plugin on our server and it has so far been alot of fun, come join in!
    * Monster hunting competition at night(33% chance to happen), giving players rewards, tracking high scores etc


Rules
Its a short list, but it has to be done

    * No large scale griefing - Yes, griefing is tolerated to an extent, it's part of minecraft, but it shouldn't be your only directive.
      Land protection plugins are installed, but not yet activated as griefing is not yet a problem
    * No large amounts of lava/water where it doesn't belong - This is probably counted under the above rule, but I wanted to give it it's own. Lava and water flowing is currently enabled, if you put it where it does not belong I may cry, and then disable it.</description>

This Is a brand new server and were looking for dedicated members! That could be you!

      <name>Let's Play Minecraft</name>
      <description>The LPMinecraft (LPMC) server is the extremely private and exclusive server associated with the website and community described below.

Let's Play Minecraft (lpminecraft.com) is community website which aims to build Minecraft content the best way possible, through its community.  Yes there's a wiki, yes theres a skins site, and yes there is YouTube for Let's Play videos.  


However:

Do you get recognition for additions you make to the wiki?  No you don't, they get the credit.

Can you have people see who made that skin they downloaded, rate it and thank you for it?  Not really.

YouTube is great but you are competing with millions of other Let's Play series's and it is difficult to have your great content noticed at first.

What we are doing is building an information base/social network/forum/blog that will encompass the best thing about Minecraft.... It's community.  It will all be merit based so if you write a good edit on the wiki.  It will be tied to your profile.  If you make a popular skin, it will be tied to your profile and rank e.t.c e.t.c.   Loyal and committed members will also have their own (customisable) Minecraft blogs within the site which will also be yes... you guessed it... tied to your profile.

All in all we aim to make place where every minecrafter will want to hang out:

"A place for information, a place for content, a place for you, and a place for everything minecraft."

Check out the site http://www.lpminecraft.com (totally under-construction much like the game) although there is more content on the YouTube http://www.youtube.com/user/lpminecraftvideos.

Anyway, hope to see you soon in the forums .... or maybe on the server :D

      <description>OK, just a simple server, but we are growing.

At spawn there isn't much to be seen and guests don't have build rights, but once you get on, and the Admin is online you will get build rights pretty soon.

Some rules should be taken in consideration:

1. NO Griefing allowed!!!!
2. Do not steal from others, we are willing to help when we got some free time, no need to steal.
3. Check out our website regulary since we are just starting, you may find some news about any changes or upgrades etc.
4. The website is monitored by mcbans.com, if you have a global ban you can't connect to our server, just go to www.mcbans.com look up your name and check the reason why you got banned and how to undo this.
5. We don't cheat on our server, we are working on a ingame economy and this will allow you to get all the materials you need for prices that are transferred to the map's rarity, still work in progress.
6. If we find that you got some superpowers and use that on our server, you may risk a ban, so better not to use them at all, this includes flying and any other kind of hack.
7. The server is not PVP, so attacking other players does not make any sense and is not appreciated, we are working on special area's for PVP though.
8. The server is rented, this means it is fast, but also has limitations, right now only 2.250.000 blocks can be explored, and we allready reached this limit, so please don't go explore yourself, instead use /warp city and if the admin is online he will give you build rights, after you aggreed on a certain build site.
9. Always be nice to others, if they don't treat you nice, just send a private message in chat, for instance /m RadioMan71 [Playername] stole my diamond sword.
10. When a sign tells you not to do something, then don't do this, unless you have permission of the owner of this sign (signs outside houses are placed by me or the mod, so ask them for more info.
11. This is probably the most important thing, always be nice to others, most importantly to me (users RadioMan71 and RadioMania) because I pay for this server and when you don't like me or anything, just leave the server, there are alot of others, just don't give me ideas that I don't want to continue with the server anymore, because there are others that do like to be on this server.
12. The server admin always has the final word.</description>

      <description>Hi and Welcome.

We are a few guys playing on my minecraft server and wish new players welcome! Our server is mainly a build server, focusing on no /kits and realism. But of course it's also allowed to do whatever you want as long as you follow the rules, and behave nicely against others. Unless you agreed with another player to deal some damage   

Basically, common sense is our main rule!

Rules:
1. Do not steal, or destroy others creations.
2. No Griefing.
3. Do not lit forest on fire, if you need to. Ask a OP for permission and plan it wisely.
4. No Cheats(noclip, item spawner, etc).
5. No Random Attacking. PVP Allowed if both parts agrees.

      <description>SMP - 24/7 - 16 gigs ram - dedicated - 50 mbs connection - zero lag!

Server: MCNSA.com (Yes, that's all you have to type)

We are an established server with about 6 months under our belts. We recently upgraded our hardware and are looking for fresh meat players to come and enjoy some SMP goodness. We have around 270 members on our [1] subreddit. Many players use our mumble channel as well, so if that's your thing you'll have someone to talk to.


We'd love to have you, so here's some info.

This is an SMP server, you are expected to survive.
Mods don't give out items.

Griefing is not tolerated and we have several mods (as well as moderators) that keep this to a very minimum. Even if a griefer comes in, destroys everything we be able to undo all the damage for you.

The server itself is hosted off of 16 gigs of ram, a 50 mbs connection, a 3.2 GHz processor, and all data is written to a SSD for maximum performance.

Backsass to mods is tolerated as long as it is reasonable. No noob towers, overly offensive language, or buildings close to spawn will be tolerated.

We have mods in place to protect structures, as well as chests, furnaces, doors, and dispensers.
TNT and flint and steel are disabled for obvious reasons, as is fire spread.

Basically the rules are don't be a complete ass, respect others, and play nice. Have fun, but not at others expense. We are a tight knit community but are very welcoming to new players. So please check us out.

We are MCNSA.com</description>

      <description>Hello! Welcome to a new minecraft SMP server. Here we have a city with a small economy, so please join! We have simple rules: Inside the city, there will be no griefing, stealing, and killing. Outside the city, there is no rules, it's almost like a free for all, but there is no abusive use of TNT or lava. We have a player ranking system, with various ranks. The owners of the server, are Wintendo1 and Gman8403. We are nice guys and love to joke around, so please come with a sense of humor! Please respect our community players like you would like to be treated. Also, there will be NO tolerance of racial slurs. When in the server, please go up to the rule board and read each one, so that you do not have to ask us, what are the rules, or anything like that. Thanks!</description>

      <name>Komandokyle's awesome {DEDICATED} server</name>
      <description>Email ewok93@yahoo.com for whitelisitng, we may add a paid partial op system, including most blocks, though without tnt, lava, water, etc.. We test plugins and make sure they run well, we will soon have an information kiosk explaining how to use them and other fun facts about the server. We have a dedicated mining area where you can mine for ore, and you can trade it in to an admin if they are on and receive better quality blocks. We are a dedicated server, so we have 99.99% uptime, and run quickly. (Based in Phoenix, AZ, but Komandokyle runs just fine, and he is on the east coast). Most of the server management is done by dumbbum21 (real name Erik and he usually goes by Ijss, pronounced ice). If you want an awesome server, join ours! We run on bukkit btw</description>

At the moment there is no whitelist as I'm currently stress testing the server, so in saying that there are no rules yet either.
To get the most of playing here it would be best for you if you were located in the Aus/NZ region, others are more than welcome but expect to have a laggy experience.

If you do find that you get lag playing here, please reply to this post stating where you are from and what your internet connection is :)

Other than that enjoy, bump this post if you want to see this turn into a decent private build server and try not to set everything on fire =]</description>

      <name>FreeSMP - A great new server [Hamachi] [NO premium required!]</name>
      <description>I've set up a vanilla SMP server - no rules, no mods. Go wild.
Hacks will be banned, other than that it's a free-for-all.

If anyone wants OPs (able to /give yourself items etc) just ask.

It'll be hosted whenever my machine is online, which is a large portion of the time (if not quite 24/7).
Offline-mode is on, so non-premium users can connect too!

Features:

- Free miner starter kit!
- /sethome to set your respawn location /home to tp there /spawn to tp to spawn
- Mobs enabled!
- PVP enabled (no ganking / 'griefing' though)
- A stable economy : Ingame currency (Bedrock) actively traded around!
- Regions! Currently allows you to buy a safe-zone (costs bedrock)
- If you need something, you'll have to dig for it - operators do not give out free treats
- Backups are taken every hour
- More features get added weekly (custom coded)
- Running on a heavily optimized mc server to lower the amount of 'lag'
Coming soon:

- Website, fully integrated (track stats, ...)

Rules:

- Racism, griefing, ganking == Ban
- Do not ask ops for items, you must mine them.
- Ops do have to mine their own stuff, when not building 'server-wide' structures

Make sure to read the rules / commands put on signs at the spawn.

Have fun!</description>

All For The Pursuit Of Riches.
Or Maybe Your The Type That Like To Cause Mayhem Where You Step So The Whole World Knows Your Name If So Then You A Black Templar, Dark Rogues That Live For The Soul Purpose To Slaughter Others But This Doesnt Come Cheap Along With Having A Bounty On Your Head As High As The Sky You Will Also Have To Steal Everything You Need To Live You'll Be Outcasts, But Who's To Say You Wont Forge A New Path And Take The World By Force.

      <description>Hallo und Willkommen auf unserer Page.

Da du hier bist geh ich davon aus das du bei uns auf dem Server MineCraft spielen willst, Richtig?
Falls das der Fall ist beachte bitte die Regeln die du hier oder im Forum findest.

Ansonsten gibts nicht viel zu sagen. Uns gibt es so wie wir jetzt sind seit dem 20.03.2011. Wir haben uns mit dem MaxiCraft Server zusammengeschlossen.
Da es uns erst seit dem 20.03 giebt ist der Server nat&#252;rlich noch nicht ganz fertig, daher kann es sein das er eine gewisse Zeit lang nicht erreibar ist oder ihr w&#228;rend des
spielens rausfliegt. Wir bitten dies zu entschuldigen und hoffen das ihr uns das verzeiht.
Falls du bei Maxicraft spielen willst Berwerbe dich im Forum Thread "Bewerbungen f&#252;r Maxicraft"
Falls du bei Minicraft spielen willst Berwerbe dich im Forum Thread "Bewerbungen f&#252;r Minicraft"

      <description>Fast overview: mobs=yes pvp=yes/in wilderness trade/money=yes easy place to become rich=no 


Well you can pretty much do anything you like.The world is Pvp, and not a very easy place to excell. You have the choice to just live off the land out in the wilderness, or try and amass enough money to have your land protected.Or go the cheaper route and buy land in city. 
Our money is iConomy based, and the coins are called Trade-Bars. Player shops will be avialable when iConomy finally supports them and they work correctly. 
Titles are mostly land owned/protected area presently although new titles/groups are in consideration for the loner who wants nothing to do with "civilized lands" 
Griefing is frowned upon, but if you live in the wilderness expect it! City life is so much easier. 
You can make money by selling certain items to shops, or to other players. Maybe even get hired to perform a job for someone. Sever stores presently always buy iron,gold,coal,redstone,diamonds and sell them, and bread,fish,apples, and other food related goods. Soon as player shops work there will be more shops then you will know what to do with. 
You do not have to buy land, you can wonder out in the country and build if you want. DO NOT BUILD huge monolithic structures near cities or other settled lands or there is a good chance they will be griefed/removed. 
With enough time invested in the server, you can buy enough land to start selling it. forming a small village, with more land and population you might even make king at some point! its all up to you. Be the best Farmer ever! or wheel and deal to become a Baron. 
Hope to see you there! </description>

&#8211;adjective
characterized by extreme simplism; oversimplified: a simplistic notion of good and bad.


Here at Simplistic we like to keep things simple and fun.
This server is straight up survival with no mods, no set currency and no fancy laws.
Just a small server with a white-list and a few rules...
Rule One: Respect other players things.
Please do NOT steal, modify, destroy or build in other fellow players "building sites".
Rule Two: Don't be a bitch.
Don't be a bitch.


If your doing something you think your not supposed to be doing. 
Stop.

      <description>Nether Dragons is an 80-slot server dedicated to enhancing vanilla Mine Craft by adding functionality to in-world items but keeping the game balanced. We offer a grief-free environment and let our 100% uptime record attest to our reliability. We don't host remotely, and we use a dedicated machine in-house and remote monitoring meaning that if anything ever goes wrong a server restart is usually only a click away. Maps are backed up on a nightly basis as well. We offer a graphical web interface to all players allowing you to chat with people on the server real-time, view in-game time and see a list of all currently connected players with live locations updated every single second. We do not allow war on our main server map(more below)*. Our primary goal is to provide a 24/7 safe environment from all but the Creepers themselves!</description>

This is a Swedish server used mainly by me and my friends but we would love if you joined us on our adventures! We like to explore, mine stuff, kill monsters, build on our fortress and so on. We play "realistic" and don't build stuff that is too crazy. Are you like us? Then join :)

By the way, we use no mods or anything like that. Just a clean minecraft server.</description>

When mobs are on survival is most likely the #1 goal, however feel free to build fun and interesting things regardless of your desire to survive. If you have any other questions, find one of our OPs in game: aelsi (owner), AlexCitto, donpachi, or Davecon. We are currently set to a 15 player limit (not including OPs) and use basic mods that don't change the vanilla feel to the game.&lt;br&gt;

      <name>Chillout - Mature Survival [24/7][NoPVP][Myhome][PS][nether][multiverse][dedicated]</name>
      <description>Hi there.

we just started building a new didicated server. We have a normal survival server with "free to build/break blocks) except areas that other have a PreciousStone placed. But dont allow griefing/mindless destroying of scenery

Current player mods: (more info on signs at spawn area)
- PreciousStone - protect ure building area
- Myhome (a mod that lets you teleport ureself once every 15 min to ure home and where u spawn after death. With a warmup of 5 sec so you cant cheat lava death etc)
- Nether world

You will need to be mature. Dont beg admin for free stuff or op and behave nicely. Use common sence
As for chat: No spamming, yelling, extensive OMFG!! LOL!!, noob calling etc

Server info for Chillout:
Dedicated 24/7 server
Animals and mobs are on
Will get iconomy (coins/sell/buy/shops) up and running eventually (when mod for new craftbukkit is done)
have multiverse with nether (hellworld) support
No pvp
Hack/grief protected - Whitelist and gem stones to protect area aswell as different mods to protect global server and rollback mistakes/griefers (yes this is our primary focus :D)
Daily server backups
Aim: small friendly mature community. (around 10 players online during day time)

      <description>Latest Craftbukkit (b635) works with Minecraft Beta 1.4 and essentials plugins do work!!!
http://ess.earth2me.com/index.php/Command_Reference

No griefing please,No Mods, PvP Disabled, Free roam My friends!
Just a temporary test server, to check for any issues on my network/server.
If it works i'll probably invest in a more stable server.
You are always welcome to show me some tricks of the trade, as I have no idea what to do with economy or how to lock doors/chests yet.

(It's whitelisted for now as I have to get better protection or if I can figure out essentials a bit more)
Last time my server was public and non whitelisted all sorts of griefers came in, so only trusted people will get access

Server Located in Gatineau, Province of Qu&#233;bec in Canada.

Initial newcomers to the server will automatically be Peasants, giving them basic build rights. Peasants do not have the /sethome and /home commands that Citizens do. They also do not enjoy the privileges of the /LWC commands that allows players to protect their chests, doors, furnaces, and dispensers from intrusion.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

You MUST register at our website with the exact name as used in Minecraft to be considered a Citizen.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Mods/Plugins&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

mcMMO (level different skills and overall level, get better at doing things)&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Runecraft (build magical runes)&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

BetterShop (buy and sell item to earn credits)&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

LWC (protect your chests, doors, furnaces...)&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

iZone (protect an entire area by request)&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

MultiVerse:  There are three alternate worlds now, the default world (known as Podzonia), a new world named Xenois, and a netherworld named Underworld.  It costs 20,000 Credits to go to Xenois.  Return trip is free.  Underworld portal is free.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone! Welcome to DeadlyParadox, we hope to see you in our server very shortly! Let me give you a little background information first, before playing. Our server is a true survival. No spawning items, everything is legitimate, and mobs are also turned ON. Another small thing to note is our servers has nether and RPG elements. You can level up in woodcutting, fishing, unnarmed combat, swordsmanship, herbalism, mining, and so much more. These upgrades give you new abilities, and even faster completion of things. Lets say I level up my swordsmanship, I do more damage to mobs now!

      <name>Mine Conquest</name>
      <description>We are a relatively new server and are a hybrid of creativity and survival; by saying this I mean we offer grief protected areas for a slight premium to build there, but the server is primarily survival. The server, Mine Conquest, has few small and large cities scattered through out the map, these are owned by Admins and they make decisions for their towns/ cities. We promote griefing and looting and please don't whine if this happens to you. Our server also includes iconomy and we support clans or nations (whatever your preference). Admins aren't always on so we have our contact info under /rules so you can report hackers or problems or lag if you wish. We are also now selling (in-game economy, not actual money) customizable lots or apartments pre-assembled. We also have the option to make your own stores and set your own prices and start making money and trading between clans, etcetera.

Our server is not broken up into clans but rather into nations/ countries. These nations make their own rules and laws and government. They choose the way they survive; diplomacy or conquest. The capitals of these nations have to be known and are protected to where only members of the country can access items in there. Cities excluding capital are not required to have coords known.

On our server there is a a union called the Mine Conquest Trade Union, it is a trading agreement between nations, nations are not required to join, but always have the option.

Current Nations:

Oz; leader: nightman2000 (a small nation that is the center of the Mine Conquest Trade Union 'a group of nations that trade together'), Capital: Undermine; coords: X:-319 Y:97 Z:124

Happy Tree Friends; leader: Liekmudkipzz (The largest nation containing around 10 citizens and also the most powerful.), Capital Pony Island; coords: X:-55 Y:65 Z:-56

Atlantis; leader: JordanSorrells (a startup nation that is the smallest of all) Capital Atlantis; coords: X: 19 Y:73 Z:299

This is NOT a whitelist server, we want all to play and enjoy, IF you want to donate visit our blog for more information.

Itisnotme460 Email: cars460@gmail.com Bhg1996's email: bhg1996@gmail.com

Admins: ITisnotme460 (owner), bhg1996, jessedake1, pwnvader360, vTwIsTeD. We are open to adding more and we also need moderators.

Our Rules:
1. NO hacking or mackros, this includes fly mods, speedmods, etcetera.
2.No overuse of profanity, this does not mean you will get punished for cursing, but we prefer it not be all your vocabulary.
3. No whining when griefed or looted.
4. Respect Admins and other players.
5. No offensive skins that are related to profanity, politics, or anything that might anger people.
6. Ask Admins for other rules

      <description>Our server is dedicated to giving everyone the most rights possible. We won't kick or ban you for swearing like other smp servers do. We have no whitelist, so anyone can get in at anytime of the day, any day of the week. Our server runs 24/7 and we have a group of dedicated and helpful admins that aren't just a bunch of power hungry jerks that wont let you have a good time. We have a pvp region, and a pve region, so the server appeals to the competitive griefer/thief, and the passive, laid back people that just wanna build and start their own settlements off the beaten path. Ask the admins any question you want, and they're sure to answer! Whether your a seasoned Minecraft veteran, or a noob just trying out your first server, this server is the one for you! We are also currently making a website so that you can keep in touch with the server, both in Minecraft, and out!

we have many mods installed including:
iConomy
Fly,Ridge,Fly
WorldGuard
WorldEdit

AND MANY MORE! The list grows every day!

COME ON DOWN TO MINEFEST! YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO LOSE!</description>

      <description>Australian Based, town, half-spawn. You need to use skype and a microphone to get building rights. We don't judge voices :) Allocated blocks of land will be handed out, or some may be requested, after asking Owner or Admin. Then you shall take up residency, simple items we like the town to be built out of are supplied, explained more in server. The more complex ores, you have to mine yourself. No destroying the surface of town. Underground is NOMADS land!

Hope to see you there!</description>

      <description>Our lethal-zone.eu server has a easy going but strict mentality, you can build where you want as long as you dont greeve on other players. Once you are a regular you will be placed in the lethal group and have more privileges over others. (nothing groundbreaking) but nice to have things. Minecart mania and craftbook are in place as are Essentials.

Come by and see for yourself.

      <description>Welcome to the Server Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First things first this is a SMP server meaning there are hostile mobs that spawn. All spawn but the creepers will not BLOW YOU UP wahoo! Next is this a pretty new server so alot of places are still open to build just please don't build to close to others unless they allow you too do so. (Will go into detail about more rules later) There are a few mods installed to keep us safe and to also allow for easier use of the minecarts. 

You will need to visit http://mgmnetlan.com and post a request to get a builder status as joining you can walk around but you do not have build status.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
List of the mods will be below:

Protection:
&#8226;BigBrother
&#8226;WorldGuard

Bonus's to game play:
&#8226;Essentials
&#8226;Minecart Mania
&#8226;MyWarp

Misc:(behind the scenes or not used by the players)
&#8226;Permissions
&#8226;IChat

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently there are a Few Moderators and a Couple Admins on the server:

Admins:
&#8226;Dateranoth (Second in command)
&#8226;Saladin1980 (Head admin/Owner)

Moderators:
&#8226;Grinmore (Head Mod)

      <description>This is an all out everyone against themselves, You can kill people you can rob them This includes going in their houses/towns to get what you want :). Its all war. Please enjoy your stay.. Only main rule you have to worry about, is do not kill in spawn area which will be surrounded in obsidian SO ITS OBVIOUS!!!



Rules:
1.) DO NOT KILL PEOPLE IN SPAWN AREA!!!! Only non killing area in this server is the spawn. IF CAUGHT KILLING IN THIS AREA WILL RESULT IN A BAN!!!
2.) This is an all out fighting war... everyone against them selves...Killing eachother taking their stuff... going in their towns/houses robbing them...
3.) Have Fun
4.) Cussing is fine, to an extent, towards people we don't mind aslong as your not outdoing it.</description>

      <name>ObliviTronic SMP</name>
      <description>ObiviTronic SMP is a rising server. I, Knapier89 (THE Admin), am constantly working to make the server better as I see fit. I used to host a Classic server for a couple of months, so I am not so "new" to server administration. If you're new to the server, you'll be ranked Visitor by default. Once you have shown faithfulness to the server, you will be ranked a Member. We accept anybody and everybody. However, we strive to gain users who will be loyal and faithful to the server. We're not out to gain more people than another server, we just want to have a friendly community. And THAT is the basic principle of the server, we are a Community. I also have some mods installed and I am always working and configuring them to be the best they can be on my server. So launch the game, type in the IP, and join the community of ObliviTronic SMP.

We also have a Facebook group, Members should join at: http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_168027769914311&amp;ap=1

Notes:
At the moment, there are 12 player slots. When the server starts hitting this mark, I will add more.
As of right NOW, there are NO mobs.
There is currently no Nether, but that's about to change thanks to MultiVerse ;)
Freely spawning of items is forbidden because in my opinion, it is cheap and unfair.

      <description>This is a free server.

PVP is OFF
I trust you can all be grateful that I give you all build rights... So respect other's property.
We have a back mark system in place. 5 = Temp ban. 5 more = Perm ban.
NO abusing.
NO greifing.
NO swearing.
NO ACCESS to Mass_Debators house at any time! (Unless granted)

Respect admins, they are all friendly.
Server owner: Mass_Debator    -    Respect him more :) be kind and helpful and I may op you, and grant access to the admin quarters.

So yeah, enjoy free building. Chests are at the spawn for storage of materials so you do not have to go mining. Please respect that some items are banned. </description>

      <description>Just like the title says, new survival multiplayer server, we don't give out free items. New users can either leave a comment in this thread to get added to the whitelist and look around, or go to http://treesquid.tumblr.com/ to ask to join. We will take you for tour, or you can head to the trial zone and start building whatever you'd like. If we like it, or you seem like a cool unit, we'll promotote you, give you a spot of land to build in the city, and or move your structure into a city. Feel free to bring friends. 

Currently only an 8 slotter (reccomended, might be able to handle more), with about 3-4 people on at a time, so far we have 10 close friends with accounts, but we haven't reached max yet. If we hit lag with more than 8 people on, we'll upgrade our memory. It's free to play (donations accepted for server upkeep), and if you'd like a list of mods we're running feel free to ask.

Note: We're all betwen 20 and 30 years old, mostly on the younger side. We are NOT politically correct, and some may find structures offensive. If you're feint hearted or have no sense of humor, there's another server out there for you, keep an eye out.

Turning the whitelist off for today if you'd like to take a peak, log on. If we like you, we'll let you build too.


Edit: We run Bukkit with nearly no downtime. I may restart the server now and then for mods, but it's rarely down longer than 5 minutes. Mostly I just use an ingame reload that has no effect on your play</description>

You are an Inmate at the highest security prison in minecraft!  Here in Prisoncraft, Life is terrible.  The meals are horrible, the Staff is dreary and demanding, and there is little chance of escape. Or is there?  Build up your recourses, Create tools (or weapons) and fight back!  But if you caught, Prison block Theta is for you, where we pride ourselves on keeping the soon-to-be criminally insane alive! Barely!  If your good, you may get promoted to A certain job, where you are slightly more comfortable as you plan your escape!  Have fun, Choose if you want to be rebellious or nice to the Guards and the Wardens, and Try To Escape!!!

A few mods we have added:
1# Torches, when right clicked into open air, will be lit, and you can hold them for about 30 seconds, and they give off a light, press r to extinguish, great for exploring... if you know what i mean...
2# We are now in Normal mode, but without enemies, so food IS valuable, and pvp will be punished.  if you get hurt, run to the Doctor or the cook!
3# not really a mod, but i have added even more ways out, and when out, there are clues as to where you must go to get to the real world, as you are still on the island untill you pass the HUGE wall at 500.


Oh and one last thing: my goal for this server is to have the limit of 30 players reached at least once, after that ill set a new goal, like once a day, but right now, when i turn off the whitelist, if we get 30 on at once, that will be an awesome day!  But until then, stay tuned...

      <description>There are very few rules and limitations, and we have a few plugins installed so far. If you have any plugins you would like to be added, you can just send me a message in game or on my AIM (travtrigs) and I will look into it. The only rules there are right now are:

- [1] Dont destroy anything you didnt build
- [2] Dont build near anything you didnt build without permission from a Moderator or Admin
- [3] If you begin a project and then abandon it, make sure you delete all traces of it
- [4] If youre going to build something that may be an eyesore, make sure you build it far away from other peoples creations

There isn't a whitelist as of now, but as more people join I may implement one.</description>

Type: Survival

Shadow-Craft started out as a basic vanilla server in hopes we could just stay one of the few Survival servers in the Minecraft world, the way SMP should be played. But in turn, we have gotten heavily griefed and switched to mods such as hMod to protect us from these potential griefers. Now we have a semi-popular server with a sign-up system on the website in order for you to build and keep everyone's creations safe. We have chest protections, cuboid, or area protections, a currency system, and are in development for a Warzone on a seperate server that is PVP. This server is not PVP and also has empires for the admin. Please read our rules by typing /rules in-game, and enjoy our server. Thanks for stopping by!</description>

      <name>Kingdom of Burge</name>
      <description>[...] And so Michael Burge led his people from the untamed dark wilderness and taught them to behave not as the sheep - who trampleth over thine wheat - nor the creeper - a victim of his own lust for power and domination, lashing out at those who have when he does not. No, his people were true to him, and they prospered." -- The Book of Burge 7:83

Michael Burge - Champion Minecraft Player of the Ages; 12-time Winner of the Grand Spleef Tournament Prix; Defeater of the Mighty Bonetail in Super Paper Mario in Chapter 1 - comes to you today offering access to his perfect Minecraft server: his mighty Kingdom within which dwells Michael Burge himself. Review my server's plentiful offerings: when you eventually conclude that Michael Burge is truly a God among gods and are overtaken by a desire to build monuments in his name, he will be there to take you.

Areas

Burgetopia

A bustling city still in its early zoning stages, Burgetopia is an ocean city that needs your help to grow. Buy a plot of land in our residental district or a store zone in the commercial district and make His Eminence's capital city the envy of all! 

The Wilds

In order for Michael Burge to rescue his people, they must have had an enemy. In these wilds are creepers, griefers, lava pools, TNT, and all of the other things that buying city land protects you from having to deal with. These wilds are currently the only source of money in the economy - spiders, zombies, and creepers drop it on death - and you have to live here until you can farm enough money to buy land in the city.

PleasantVille

A floating city to the south of Burgetopia, the owner is heavily in debt after taking a large loan from Michael Burge. Can you be the one to help him on his way to financial independence, or will he forever be forced to slave in the Redstone mines for Michael Burge's Redstone Academy?

Other? 

Many people feel unworthy to live in the presence of Michael Burge's shining eminence. If you feel this way and can convince him you can gather a substantial(5+) following of people, he can zone you a town which will remain yours for as long as you continue to pay tribute to him.

Features 

Towny: Town/nation zoning
PvP: Individual towns can decide whether to allow Player vs. Player fighting or not(the capital does not), but you can always find homes in the Wilds to loot. Find some poor souls' well-hidden house, and you might have yourself a new home and a free iron pickaxe to boot.

Marketplaces:
Unfortunately in today's unstable economy the love of Burge will not sustain your churches. The construction of the Great Pyramid of Burge or the Grand Burge Cathedral will not be possible without the labor given by thousands of Burgelots.

Many have taken to hawking their useless junk at passers by. They circle around the marketplace like hungry vultures until they spot a full wallet, and then they dive in for the attack. Will you be forced to help starving children in Africa out of a vague sense of morality, or vote on the latest political issue? Not if Michael Burge can help it - but you may be sold Redstone or Diamond.

WorldEdit: 
A very powerful tool capable of molding entire cities, this is deemed too dangerous for you the reader to use. Fortunately Michael Burge and his christened disciples are willing to plot your lands, replace entire sections, fix your water's current, copy/paste or rotate your creeper statues' face, etc. for a very reasonable price. 

Since WorldEdit is more an out-of-game feature than an in-game one, the money from any fees will be ejected out of the economy so you can't keep making your houses out of diamond blocks: money is actually being lost, not just moved around.

MMO Skills: 
Chop enough trees/mine enough iron/kill enough people/fall off enough buildings taking damage and killing yourself/etc. and you'll get better at it. Blocks will have a chance to drop twice as much at lower levels, and even more at very high levels.

Building Projects: 
If you can prove yourself as an architect, the city is willing to buy your services. The main entrance to the city, the spawn point, and endless other areas need your help! You're always free to build in our residential district once you have the money for a plot(like most of us have done), but these community projects are important as well.

Runecraft
No one except the great Burge has unlocked the secrets of Runecrafting. Perhaps you will be the second.

Griefer Protection: 
Burgetopia is nigh-immune to griefing. Feel free to build a TNT cannon off in the distance, and shoot TNT blocks at our city! Unless you are someone useful, you can't do anything in our city except admire the architectural brilliance of Michael Burge. Feel free to look at our city and how happy we are from the outside while your dirt house rots from the inside with griefers and creepers.

Pure outsiders can do nothing except walk around our city; and even regular residents can only build in plots of land they've bought. Only residents proven to be competent trustworthy architects are given the right to build anywhere in the city, and even these can't open people's front doors or pour lava through their windows. If you secure your chest in a padded cell, you can be confident that nobody will loot it(except for Michael Burge himself - he's the server admin and will steal your diamonds).
No Whitelist: Everyone should be able to experience Michael Burge; he does not reject those seeking him. Anyone can connect to our server and walk around the city; though your permissions are limited for obvious reasons. You can build a house in the wilderness if you like, but then you're unprotected. Anybody can join, and anybody can prosper on our server.

Note: Hackers are the exception: if you're caught hacking, we will ban you immediately. You may also be banned if Michael Burge is irritated you said "I could care less" rather than "I couldn't care less" - Michael Burge really hates that.

Join our server at 69.197.190.28:25565 today and Michael Burge will show you pages upon pages of written text detailing how great he is!</description>

      <description>OpenPvP is a new server I just made up that currently holds 10 people ( may increase or decrease depending on server load). The idea of this server is to have fun, pvp, form allies, and form enemies.

Rules:
Since this is a strictly PvP server griefing is allowed, however griefing mods/hacks are not this includes the use of X-ray, fly, speed hacks, etc will result immediate action such as warning,kick, and depending on the severity or number of offenses ip ban . And any mods that give you unfair advantage in pvp are also a bannable offense.

Note: there may be significant downtime due to permissions being in the work.</description>

We are an upstart server at the moment with 12 player slots, but remote hosted, so nearly 100% up-time!

New users are free to look around but must ask for permission to build, its not that hard to get, but you do need the administrators approval. 

Come check us out, everyone is free to explore our world.

We are running mods that add some really neat features:
-NPCs you can interact with
-A full-scale working economy, with multiple market locations coming
-submarine-based transport between areas (currently 2 but rapidly expanding)
-available for purchase private city areas, where you can create the city to your tastes
-and much more!</description>

      <name>Entropy</name>
      <description>Entropy is the hardcore PvP server where the elite band together and prey on the weak. We are a hardcore PvP server focused on the "survival" aspect of SMP. Unlike other "hardcore" servers that prevent griefing and stealing from houses, we believe that these are core elements to the concept of survival. When you first spawn in the server, you are introduced to Spawnton, the only safe haven in the world of Entropy. Here you can buy and sell weapons, armor, and food with other players with the in-game currency of Marks (implemented with iConomy). Build out in the Wild and try to hold your own, join any player-made faction for protection, or start your own faction. But beware. For every person you pillage from, there's at least 3 others looking to pillage right back. Defenses in the form of traps, false houses, and mob spawners will keep your loot safe....at least for a while.

      <description>NinjaCraft is a Survival Build server. While we have mobs turned on and spawning items kept to a minimum by admins, people also can build worry free because creeper damage is turned off.

We have PVP Control, so only people who have typed /pvp on can fight.  They must both have it enabled to fight.  Its a nice way to get PVP aswell as people who dont want it can refuse too.</description>

      <name>The Boss Server</name>
      <description>This is a boss server. Many mods in use that most players can access. It's pretty wild on this server so be ready for anything. This server is like a mix of a free build and a survival server, but it's more of a free build. Creeper don't explode and you can change the time of day when every you like. This server is normally up 24/7 but occasionally it is down for small periods of time. Grieving isn't tolerated at all on this server. If you are caught grieving then there will be no warning you will just be ban. But beside that we are friendly people who like to play minecraft, build random stuff and hunt zombies, so come take a look!

      <description>Welcome!

This is a quiet server. VPS hosted in London, UK.
I started up the server for the first time on 14th of February, 2011.

I originally started the server for a few friends i know IRL to play on.
After resetting the world to a fresh one and making the server open to public,
i have given the chance for new players and new friends to play on it.

PVP is ON
Dont grief.
The only restricted item is the [color=#FF8000]lighter[/color], Flint and Steel. (ask for use)
If you want to be admin there is an application [url=http://xtre.freeforums.org/read-this-t8.html]here[/url]

We are looking for server suggestions

      <description>Wir haben es uns als Ziel gesetzt unseren Server als MMORPG aufzubauen um den Multiplayer-Modus noch spannender zu machen und unseren Spielern aufregende Events bieten zu k&#246;nnen. Nachdem es uns im Singleplayer zu langweilig wurde kamen wir auf die Idee einen eigenen Server zum laufen zu bringen und so ging der dieser dann im November 2010 ans Netz. Der Server lief damals noch nicht rund um die Uhr, da dieser notgedrungen auf einem Home-PC installiert werden musste und und uns kein eigener Server zur Verf&#252;gung stand. Doch seit dem 3ten Dieses Monats hat dies ein Ende da uns seit Anfang Februar nun ein Root-Server zu verf&#252;gung steht. Der Minecraft MMORG-Server ist momentan auch nichtmehr Whitelistet. Wenn euch das Prinzip zusagt k&#246;nnt ihr gerne kommen und uns joinen. Ein TS-Server mit Support steht auch zur freien verf&#252;gung. Au&#223;erdem Spondored das Team !nfected unter andrem auch CoD4-Server, Css-Server, und einen Teeworlds-Server.</description>

      <description>3EC is a fairly new Towny based PVP server - with a very hands off, diy attitude from the admins. For example admins will never spawn a block for you or teleport somewhere unless its strictly admin related, like checking out a griefer report or something like that.

Also, while PVP is enabled, we encourage our users to try and get along, settle things civilly. Or to at least wait till the other guy's back is turned...</description>

      <description>This server I created after working out how to install plug-ins I am going to try and keep up for 100%
of the time but for obvious reasons there will be daily restarts lasting for a matter of seconds and basically i created this server for me and a friend to play so we could make a world and we didn't get very far before thinking god we need more people to help build this all people who join we will ask you if you could help build the first so please join as you please and come and help us build this new amazing server shouldn't lag but it might oh and we wont force you to build you can just go make like your own house or city somewhere else but please don't be 
1. A Griefer because you are seriously frowned upon 
2.The person who is always asking to be promoted because unless i really feel you deserve it you aint getting it
3. The noob who joins the server and does nothing and just takes up one of the 20 slots that a helpful player could be using

so thanks for reading this i hope to see you soon 
Oh and before I forget there are 20 slots at the moment but if it becomes popular I am going to put it up to 50 </description>

      <description>Van-Craft isn't your typical SMP server. We don't allow mobs to roam freely on the main map but we do have other maps that contain mobs for your killing pleasure. The main world "Van-Craft" has no mobs only animals and yes you have to get your items legitimately. We also run the &#8220;towny&#8221; plug-in for town&#8217;s cities and nations and will occasionally run wars. We have no fall, Lava, and suffocating damage due to it&#8217;s a creative server in a different way then normal.


1. Van-craft &#8211; this is the main user world where all the major towns cities and other member creations are located there are no Monsters only animals in this world. We also keep this world day to maximize build time.

2. Survival &#8211; A traditional world complete with monsters and animals along with a normal day night cycle Note: Van-craft is not liable for items lost due to death in this world. Enter at your own risk.

We are a new server that has a soon to be working economy and plenty of space near spawn to build house.
We have shops operated by Admin's and OP's that have reasonable prices and plenty of stock. There are currently 3 Admins and 4 OPS. 

We have website here-http://cobblestonecity.webs.com/ 
There we have a contact page where if you want to join, send us an email and we will get back to you ASAP. 
We will also have pictures up (eventually) of near spawn, the shops, and many of the houses that we have already.

      <description>Welcome!

PunchTrees.com Community Minecraft Server

Come join us if you are serious, mature, talented and, most of all, a Minecraft fanatic. We at PunchTrees.com are striving to create a wonderful Minecraft experience for all.

We know that players like to get a look at a server before going through the trouble of signing up. For this reason we have a Guest system where anyone can log in and have a look around and chat with the staff. If you like what you see please consider joining our community.

We are a 100% dedicated staff striving to make sure this is the best server for everyone.

The server is fresh and running a brand new world. 50 slots!. We are running Bukkit with several mods like LWC, WorldGuard, Minecart Mania, Big Brother, iConomy, and others.

The spawn is located in Punchtown, a new city looking for talented builders to help it grow. Players willing to settle new towns are also warmly welcomed. Construction of a huge subway system is nearing completion and will connect many new towns in the future.

We will soon implement The Wastelands! The Wastelands will be an area on the perimeter where everything goes and chunks regenerate. Good mining out in The Wastelands I hear!! Strap on the old armour and head out to where only the brave roam...

For all the server news and rules please visit us at Punchtrees.com</description>

      <description>This is my MineOS server. It's hosted in urban Minnesota, so if you're close any lag should be mostly bearable.

This server is only open on Tuesday afternoons, where we all get together and ravage the landscape with TNT. Make whatever you want, beautiful TNT structures of any kind are welcome, but at the end of the day, we link everything up (via redstone as well as chain reactions from TNT) to a main pressure plate on top of an obsidian tower and watch the place crash and burn (mostly crash).

It's a good time.</description>

      <description>Rules:

NO Griefing
NO Harassment
NO Hacking
Have fun.

PvP is enabled but using worldguard pvp is disabled in homes and around the spawn. If you find a way around this expect to be in trouble. PvP is on to make the world interesting, not allow people to be problems for others.

I utilize the portals to add worlds with dungeons, traps, or fun looking worlds to allow exploring or a different experience the the standard generated world.
Even a nice little bedrock made maze for people to run for prizes!

Currently have Nether, Desert (Primordial Desert Generator), and Mystical Islands (Mystical Islands generator) as worlds in addition to the standard that you can explore and ponder!

Apply to our forums at:
http://shatteredminecraft.broseidon.info/forum/

Include your minecraft name or use it as your forum name and post a short introduction about yourself and what you'd like to join the server and do! We'll go over htem and get people added to Whitelist as quickly as we can!
Also Include if possible: Age, and any SMP experience you might have.

We run the latest bukkit build (updated consistantly)

Plugins currently:
-WorldGuard
-WorldEdit
-Minecart Mania Core
-Wormhole X-treme (with 3 worlds currently linked!)
-Heroic Death
-Informant

(please, have in mind that at this point we r still building some stuff at the spawn city and configuring some plugins)

Server's IP: 66.135.40.31
Port: 26765


MCP is a new small PvP server, we have 15 slots only but we've put a lot of work in creating it. We have tons of mods and some rules on the server and its whitelisted so please, read all this post before asking to go in (we wont explain these rules/mods/whatever in game and we will suppose u've read everything before asking to join. Dare to ask ingame about anything posted here and u will get yourself in trouble):

Rules:

-No griefing: Instant Ban We have several systems to avoid griefing. We use WorldGuard to protect buildings and cities and if u ask an admin they will protect your structures. In case WorldGuard fails we have BigBrother which not only is capable of discover who was the griefer, it can restore whatever was destroyed. An in case that these two mods fail for any reason, we do a backup of the world at least once a day. So griefers, stay away, u r only gonna waste ur time in here and for the rest, you can be sure we will do all in our power to protect your stuff. (If you dont ask for protection and something u built is destroyed is your own fault, well only consider griefing on protected structures and just in case someone finds a way to hack or get around the protections set in place).

-No Hacking: Instant Ban If we catch you, you are out.

-No Fire, Water, Lava: Instant Ban They r disabled anyway but it may fail.

-About stealing: As said above we will do protections on your buildings and we have LWC installed... if someone steals from you is ur fault, its a pvp server and we already have too many protections in place.

-Replant Saplings: Is for you own good, next time you need wood youll have tons of trees around and it takes you not time at all.

-Be respectful: if people starts complaining about you cause u r not, im gonna get mad and you dont want that.

-No Drama Queens: Problems will arise, me and the staff know that and we will deal with them, but if problems tend to gravitate all the time toward you and you become a headache you will be banned. We, the staff, created this server and log in to it to have fun not to deal with drama queens.

-No chat spam: Im serious about this.

-No server advertising: u get on my server to advertise yours and u will be automatically banned.

Ranks (The colors in the ranks names in here are the same colors as in their names in the game chat)

(We r still configuring some mods and there can be somethings we left out, if anything posted in here is not a reality in the game please let us know and we will fix it)

There are several ranks in the game:

U start as a Noob but since is whitelisted and you've already been accepted you will be promoted to the Default rank almost inmediatly.. but while we promote you, as a Noob u don't have any right. U can&#180;t even build/mine.

The Default rank is where fun starts. At this rank u r able to build, mine materials, ask for protections, and have fun with everybody. You have access to LWC, Craftbook, Runecraft and the /spawn, /sethome and /home commands.We will even let you set your own shop with iConomyChestShop And the best part, its 100% free :). Players at this rank r required to log in in a regular basis (not every single day and not 8 hours a day, but if we dont c you in a while we will give your spot to somebody else).

Donator is for those who want to help us pay the bills and make a bigger server (more on donations below). And it comes with some nice stuff too: You will get access to /tp and /tp here, MagicCarpet, Bandages and the /kit torch/irontools. And above that and if you wish you will be able to have your own city using towny (it has an ingame cost too, more on that below). U can be voted to become an architect (which will give you access to world edit) or be promoted to moderator whenever we need one.

Major (no color yet) will enable you to run your own city. It still will cost you 50,000 drachmas (our ingame currency) and you need at least 3 other people willing to join u. But if you have the drachmas and the friends u will get your own kingdom.

Architect (no color yet) is the coolest of our non-staff rank and its pretty amazing if you ask me. You get WorldEdit access wich allows you to build incredible stuff. "How do i get promoted to this rank?" I hear you asking... well, every month starting on May 1st the staff will vote and promote one and only one person to architect, for this you need to build something really great and ask us to review it... if we believe its awesome and urs is the best project ull get promoted to architect (have in mind that if u abuse this rank you will be inmediatly banned).

Moderator: We don&#180;t have nor need anyone right now. We only have 15 server spots and we have already 1 semiadmin and 3 admins... so we have more staff than we need. If people help us pay the bills and the server gets bigger we may look for some.

SemiAdmin and Admins: Both ranks are mostly the same and we r the ones running the show. We r friendly, love the game and we r willing to help everybody inside a set of game mechanics. If you need help, let us know.

Mods/Plugins

(We r not gonna explain the commands, they r way too many and even us have to google from time to time. So, if you need a command, please take some time and find info about the mod. A great place to start is Bukkit.org)

Above all, we use Bukkit and the plugins we use are:

Bandages
BigBrother
BorderGuard Lite : our world right now its a 6000 x 6000 square.
Citizens
Craftbook
Essentials (most of the family)
LWC
MagicCarpet
Minecart Mania (most of the family)
Runecraft : We only allow these runes: Waypoint, Teleporter, Personal Teleporter and Hidden Passage
Towny
WorldEdit
WorldGuard
iConomy
iConomyChestShop

**We may add or remove plugins, have that in mind.

Game Mechanics

This is a PvP Survival server. Cities, buildings, roads, subways and everything with a protection will have PvP and Mob Damge disabled and cities, roads and subways will have creeper damage disabled too (Single buildings wont, so be sure to light all ur buildings well if u dont want the creepers destroying your stuff). God, we will even protect mine shafts. But in the wild u are on your own and can be killed and we will not spawn items for you.

Mob damage is enable (even creeper damage) in the wild.

If you r going to build a big (really big) structure you need to have at least 1/3 of it built all by youself, but after that and if you request it (and we like it) we can help you with materials (Cobblestone, stone or wood only). 

Buildings Rules

-No 1x1 constructions or holes to the bedrock, dare to make them and i swear to got ill take u out of the whitelist.
-No offensive buildings, we dont want to offend any cry babies out there (so please, no swastikas).
-Althought the spawn city has a Greek/Roman theme u r allowed to build whatever u want.
-If you r gonna build a mine shaft, start it at least 10 blocks underground, we dont want big holes in the game.
-If you require fire, ask a staff member for it and he may place the fire.

Cities Rules

I already wrote above how to get your own city, i wont do it again in here. Just want to add something:
If you want to have your own city ull have to build a road and a subway that links it to the spawn city. The roads and subways will be standardized but we will provide you with the mats to build them. This is obligatory and and its your responsibility to do it (we may help you do the tunnel for the subway if u decide to make it underground).

Donations

OK, here is the how this works: right now im paying around US$40 a month to have this server hosted at http://multiplay.co.uk/ (u can go and check out the prices in there if you do not belive me) and i really dont mind paying it. I wanted to have my own server and now i have it and im happy with it. Its a really good hosting company, the server has no lag at all and they install the mods for me (i still have to configure them but they make my life easier)

But the truth is, 40 bucks only give me 15 player slots and 1Gb of memory. That is around US$2.65 per person and thats how things are.

While im gonna keep paying the 40 bucks and again from my own money and like i said, i dont mind do in it, adding more people to the server will require donations.

Ill set a paypal account as soon as possible and ask for US$5 donations which i consider is not really much. Im not trying to get any earnings out of this and u dont have to donate if u dont want. But I think ive added enough rewards for those who donate... so, if you like what u c once u get in the game, please give us a hand paying the bills :).

I think that is all. Now, after reading all this if you want to join us, we need some info about you:

Your Minecraft nick:
Your Minecraft experience:
At least one picture of one of your creations (we have quality standards and want to make sure u r capable of fulfilling them. So, WE REQUIRE AT LEAST A PICTURE. I wont accept any "Oh, ive created some things that u can only dream about, but i didnt take the time to take a screenshot of them, but i swear ive done them" or any excuse like that. NO PICTURE, NO JOINING, PERIOD.)

After submiting ur info, make sure to check this post in a regular basis, ill let you know in here when ive added you to the whitelist.

If you want to c some screenshots of our spawn city, u can check them here:

Be nice, Mine fairly, Build safely

Check out our site at http://bioworld1.dyndns-ip.com/ for more info!
SERVER: bioworld1.dyndns-ip.com


RULES: 1. Be nice and helpful, 2. Mine fairly and cleanly, and 3. Build safely and creatively!

We are currently running with no whitelist in order to build a userbase before enforcing it again, so if you'd like to give us a try without any application process, visit now!

Features:
AntiGrief:
BigBrother
AntiBuild
WorldGuard
LWC
Automated bi-hourly backups.
Mod staff.
Fun Stuff:
Tombstone (death chests)
DropBonus (gives normally unavailable items)
MyWarp
Feel free to suggest more!

Anyone donating at least $10 will get a you a slot on the reserve list for busy times, and donations of $35 or more gives access to a personalized title and a few extra commands. See the section below regarding donations for more information.

RULES (detailed):
1. It should go without saying, but if you are a pyro or griefer, save yourself some time and go to a world where you can be loved. We have no love for you at our world - sorry. It's not personal, you just wouldn't fit in.

2. Don't enter any area marked 'Private'. Don't look in people's chest.

3. Also, if you can't control your temper, things won't work out for you either. No inappropriate personal attacks or cussing in chat. If you are upset, use your mouth and yell all you want, then chat something that communicates your feelings in a more dignified manner. 

4. For extra credit and recognition, be generally helpful in the community and welcome new players. Don't hand out fish, but teach how to fish. Everyone should get the feeling of accomplishment of taking down a tree with their bare hands :D

5. Do not use any client-side mods or textures that give you an unfair mining advantage. Mini-map is an exception, as it provides only a slight advantage and is generally useful. 

6. Do not strip mine, shaft mine, or mine in other people's mines. Cave systems and dungeons are public. If you build a mine by your house, you can claim your mine as private. Keep you mine clean and make sure it is easy to get in and out. Ideally, this means stone stairs (or slabs) eventually. If you dig into someone else's clean and torched mine, close up the hole and dig in the opposite direction.

7. Do not carry flint/steel or lava buckets in your inventory until you are trusted by the staff. You'll know you're trusted when you don't get banned for carrying these items. No lava allowed above ground.

8. Properly mark your property with your name and whether your property is public or private. Build walls are fences and place signs as needed to control access to your property. Except in the city where lots or close together, leave some space between you and your neighbor so that your mines don't collide. No mining in the city center.

HOW TO GET BANNED NOW AND FOREVER EVERYWHERE :
1. Lying to staff will result in a permanent ban from this server and possibly others
2. Major griefing will result in a very long time ban from this server and possibly others
3. Minor griefing/stealing will result in a ban from this server
4. Personal attacks, abusive language, or inappropriate cussing in chat will result in a kick or ban from this server
5. If you have been banned, you may appeal in this thread. Starting with an apology, whenever appropriate, is good advice to follow.

DONATIONS ENCOURAGED:

The largest raw cost (ignoring labor) of running a minecraft server is internet bandwidth. Each player requires about 100K bps of bandwidth. To reserve this for your use anytime, would require reserving 32.8 GB of bandwidth per month and 100 GB/mo of bandwidth costs $10/mo. So the raw costs of the bandwidth is $3.28/mo to allow you to play anytime you wanted for as much as you wanted. Of course, more players require larger worlds, and both require more RAM and CPU power. If everyone donated $5-10/mo, then the server would support everyone playing as much as they wanted. So, to help BIOWORLD ONE be sustainable, I'm asking everyone who can afford it to donate at least $5/mo. If you donate $10 or more, then you will be added to the reservelist for the month and be able to login no matter how many players are playing. If you would like to donate, please email biomass.bioword1@gmail.com and send your
donation via PayPal to bio.mass@yahoo.com (don't forget the "."). 

Thank you for your support! I hope to see you at BIOWORLD ONE soon!

      <name>CLAN WARS! 9 CLANS! CITY! AUSTRALIAN ONLY!</name>
      <description>Hey its juliuscool.
ONLY PEOPLE FROM AUSTRALIA
i know i have made about 5 different posts about minecraft servers, but this one is (hopefully) final.
Whtat i was thinking is, (omg its such a great idea!) In the first place, everyone just makes a starting off hole in the wall(house) but then the next BIG project is to make a city. 
In the city, you can make a house( by buying blocks off other people (with gold bars, currency, later discussed) make shops to buy or sell things, make arenas or anything you can think of. there will be A capital city, called (whatever you want, post ideas for name) and you can make your own towns. 
There will be a bank, where you can have your own safe. On your first visit, you will recieve 20 Gold bars( 2 silver bars=1 gold bar) which you can buy stuff with(opr make by selling houses.

STORY!

Once upon a time, there was a vast kingdom, rich with minerals and life source.
One day, 8 Clans decided to settle there.
All of them were cooperating, but then one day, Everything changed.
The clouds became stormy, Lightning was splitting trees in half and the mountains were shaking.
After the storm had cleared out, somehow, something or someone changed the way the people comunicated with each other. When anyone saw someone else, they ran towards them and tried to kill them.
The population of the island was decreasing rapidly, until one day, there was no one to be seen.
Now it is your job to repopulate the island!

(THE CLAN WARS PART!)
This is going to be a greaT idea!
There are eight clans:
Sun clan
Darkness clan
Rain clan
Air clan
Baal Clan
Creative clan
Creature clan
Jungle clan

you can think of any other names and post them below.
Every, lets say 2 days(real life time) there will be a war. 
Clans can participate and go to the CLANWAR office and enrol.
The idea is to loot the other peoples bases(and/or kill people).

      <description>So a little bit about the server:

 We have a dedicated team of Moderators and an Admin (me) who is always available
 We run WorldGuard and a strict whitelist (so if there are any of you griefers reading this, then no you can't ruin our server!)
 We also operate McBans global banning system (http://www.mcbans.com)
 We have many plugins (a few of which are behind the scenes) which make things so much more fun!
 Unfriendly mobs are turned off so that you can BUILD BUILD BUILD!
 We run on a server with the best hardware you can find. VPS? No sir! Dedicated server for us! This means no lag (on the server side, could still be your PC) And no crashes or overloads! (If we find that we need to expand, it is as simple as a couple of clicks and a payment to move to a bigger server!)

Ok, on to some less adminny stuff..

We have many things already on the server, such as:

 A huge treehouse (which may need some maintenance) 
 An awesome and secure bank (which will be even more secure once the Pdoors plugin decides to update!)
 A recently added Park and Barn
 Airships
 A model of the USS Enterprise!
 The Moderators and Admin already have their houses
 Admin Office (which is pretty hard to miss)
 A growing town centre with lots (excuse the pun) to build upon 
 A huge pixel art of Michael Jackson
 Another huge pixel art of Notch!
 HUGE Spleef Arena - Under construction
 An Absolutely MASSIVE castle (which is state property) With so many things in it i can't even remember them all - The castle is maintained by 1997mattie

There is so much more, but really you have to see for yourself.

The current team is:
Admin: Android001
Moderator: NinjaaTurkey

Added : Nether

I want this server to be a small server. With 5-7 daily players.

Commands:

_-_-_/help
- - - /sethome
- - - /home
- - - /spawn
- - - /kit

RULES

1. NO GRIEFING (The reason I put this up is because THERE ARE SOME IDIOTS WHO HAVE NO COMMON SENSE)
2. NO STEALING (Don't take anything from chests, or if someone gets killed by mobs give them their stuff back)
3. NO TROLLING (Don't just be mean and make people mad for fun, only do this if they talk bad about someone good, or if they are a troll (trolls be prepared to be trolled &gt;:D))
4. Obey the Owner, Admins, and Mods, or be banned (duh)
5. Admins or Mods may not abuse their powers, if any of them do, report them to the Owner, Xnefoo
-----Admins/Mods may not: ban people for fun, give away a bunch of free stuff for people (only something small thy really need, like some food if they have 1 or 2 hearts left), troll/flame innocent players, or spam the area with loads of spawned blocks.
Illegal Items: TNT (in large quantities, I actually filled a giant hole with TNT and an animal blew it up, causing all of our computers to instantly freeze for about 5 minutes, like a lag nuke pretty much)

Admins:

TimeWornDoctor
Voidseeker
TrueFire
Xenoclaws &lt;------- He's Awesome!

      <description>DemonLamma's Minecraft Server is a simple survival server with very few mods. The playerbase is comprised mostly of real life friends and guildmates from various games.

We have this server listed on MCservlist and the server is whitelisted so this thread will be the contact area for people wanting to get on the whitelist.
=====
We are running 'Big Brother' which means that every action a player takes is recorded and viewable at any time, when greifed we can both find out who did it and can easily undo any damage with a few simple commands.

we are also running MCbans.
=====
Gameplay mod changes include:
#1-Being able to pick up monster spawn boxes and carry them in your inventory and re-place them elsewhere
#2-Nether Blocks are obtainable in the normal map until the nether is implemented.
#3-You can set your own spawn by using a compass.
#4-You can lock chests.
#5-you can warp between admin created nether portals for fast travel.

      <description>Evolving Worlds is just that, evolving, though it is up to you to decide where and how it evolves!

There are 3 worlds available here:
Starter area, where PVP is turned on and anyone can build
Netherworld, Same as the Starter Area, except Nether-y
Main Area, PVP is off, need special rights to build and do anything here, which you can request permission by requesting access here with your exact username, which is case sensetive

All the different worlds are accessible via portals near all the spawn areas.

To access, you can find us on MCServerlist as Evolving World, or you can connect to evolvingworld.dyndns.org

Server is auto-saved every half hour, and backed up nightly to help prevent loss, which I will back up more often if a lot of people start to play.

Will be as close to 100% up time as possible</description>

      <description>We offer a highly interactive community. In this world, YOU control the economy. The players shape the world to their own tastes. You have the choice, whether to survive in the vast wilderness we have. Or join a town, and build the biggest city in the map! If none of those suit your tastes, join and fight other players, and earn money! If you liked Minecraft Creative things, we have a gallery for you to build pixel art in! We use Towny as our main town mod, and the map is pvp.</description>

Really, this is a server for people starting Minecraft, as it's friendly and easy to look at.

The texture pack recommended is JoliCraft by Joliecuer as it is easy on the eyes and
makes the city look extra nice :3

      <description>Welcome to MadRealms: The Lost Land

"An ancient portal that leads to a long forgotten land far away was uncovered in a long buried temple. Soon adventurers started to explore the land behind the portal and founded a new
settlement for other arrivals to follow. While the conflicts in the old lands smolder more and more exiles enter the gate to look for a new fortune.
You can be one of those travellers that will venture the new lands. What awaits you? What might be the secret behind the old ruins that scatter the landscape? Join in and find out!"

We are a SurvialPlus-Server with focus on "realism". Players can found and maintain settlements, trade, hunt, farm, gather, build and battle. Our focus is on a decent community, so we also offer lots of events that forges the bonds among our members. To protect our players we have well selected, adult moderation team and a zero-tolerance rule regarding troublemakers and griefers.

MadRealms has no Whitelist, so you can join as guest, look around and apply afterwards.

For full list of features and applications please visit either our website or the thread on minecraftforum.net!</description>

      <description>Golden Creeper is a great 18+ community that's been in place for a little over 6 months now, and we would like to add some new members.  We are a 24/7 survival server running Bukkit, including:
--The full Minecart Mania suite
--Multiverse (currently with 3 worlds)
--Private and Public Warps, as well as /home
--Anti-griefing support and logging
--Tools do not break and creepers do not damage buildings (just players).

Everyone is free to log on and explore our world, but build rights are not granted until you apply on our forums at http://www.goldencreeper.com .  Applications usually take 24-48 hours to be approved.  Hope to see you soon!</description>

Rules 
1. No disrespecting admins or moderators. What they say goes. Unless if they are asking you to hand over all your diamonds :L if something like that happens report it to me.

2. No use of swearing to directly insult or hurt someone. I will tolerate mild language which is used frequently but not strong language used frequently.

3. No religious or racial slurs. In the event of this their will be an insta-ban until a decision has been reached by moderators and admins.

4. Griefing no matter how large or small is NOT tolerated as with the above rule an insta-ban will occur.

5. The use of flint and steel is strictly forbidden. Ask for permissions before using it and give me a reason. I check the inventory files daily and if you are caught with it, it will be removed and you will be warned but not banned.

6. Castle Ban Hammer is for use by admins and moderators only! Any one caught in there acting suspiciously without invite will be escorted out and warned. Insta-ban will occur if items are taken. The perimeter of Castle Banhammer where you CAN NOT dig or build is surrounded by a perimeter of torches. You can walk through and around this perimeter. You are NOT ALLOWED past the fence to Castle Banhammer anyone found here will be treated the same as if they were inside the actual Castle. This is the private property of the Admin (me) and the Moderators (even though we don't have space for Madtoaster55 there xD).

7. No taking other members items without permission. If I hear of items being stolen the one accused will not be banned but warned. Three strikes and your out for good unless if an appeal is made.

8. If someone has a house you are NOT ALLOWED in their without their permission. 

9. Sharing of links is permitted but a moderator must check them first. Three harmful links or links that contain nudity or harmful material and your out. No shortened links either please. 

Any queries? Post them here.</description>

We want to make the same experience that you get in singleplayer, online.

That means killing and stealing is allowed, creepers destroys blocks, and we try to use as few plug-ins that changes game mechanisms as possible, staying true to the spirit of minecraft.

With that:

      <description>A Brand New server, mainly for freebuild. We are looking for mods and admins. I will be taking advice on what you want added to the server, and will most likely implement it. I have a few anti-griefing measures in place and I am thinking off stepping it up a notch so you will have to earn build rights instead of starting with them. There will be constant backups if someone does manage to grief, but i hope to use these as a last resort, and just stop the griefing before it starts. We are using the Minecart Mania mod for easy minecart usage. Any other mods that are requested will most likely be implemented. This server will try to be run 24/7, but might have some downtime until it is fully done. Join and have fun now!</description>

      <description>An extremely fun survival mode server. It's almost your typical survival mode server, except for a few serverside mods that make the server much more interesting to play. We have an economy, a banking system, a housing and plot system, and NO WHITELIST. We have a very good Ban system setup so that if a player is banned from other servers, he can be banned from ours as well to prevent griefing and idiots. There is full PVP outside of protected areas. Raiding is a MUST! It's extremely enjoyable and adds a whole new aspect to the game. There is a bit of roleplaying as well, so there are definitely a ton of reasons to come check out the server. ADMINS ARE ONLINE ALMOST 24/7 AND THE SERVER IS UP 24/7. The server saves frequently so there should be no loss of work at all. The server currently has 30 slots. If there is a need to expand we probably will, but 16 slots will be suitable for now.</description>

      <description>!!  WORK IN PROGRESS !!  ,but when we are ready... Look forward to fully tested mods in use. (example) : auctions &amp; the new *RESIDENCE plugin - *Residence is different from most protection plugins in that it aims for the users to be able to protect their own homes without having to bother the admin to do it. Residence has support for a variety of different protection types including preventing movement through areas, all of which can be configured by the land owner, and limited by the admin.

Our server will be 1 of a kind; made to play the way we've been searching for in servers &amp; never found. I'm sure you'll agree when we launch..

      <description>Looking for players to join our sever. It has 10 player slots and is up 24/7. If the mod you want is not installed ask an admin to install it for you.

We are a group of about 4 friends looking for people to join our small server (with bukkit mods). We are looking for mature (we dont mind the odd rude joke every now and then), experienced and kind players. We will not except anyone who is known for griefing, hacking or any other form of unfriendliness (we will check using mcbans). 

It is a survival server (creeper damage off) with some elements of a RPG servers, such as a shop and a weekly lottery. We have houses which you can buy in the main town or you just build your own in the wilderness, anything is fine! You can choose wether you want to find materials your self or use our money system to buy them from the shop. You can keep your items in a protected bank or you can hide them deep underground. We also have special events such as; meetings in the town hall where we discuse matters of importance, snow ball fights in the snowball arena or gladiator tourniments in the champions arena. 

The money system is very simple and effective. Each player starts of with $50 and you can add more money on to that by 
A) selling items eg wood, saplings, obsidian (the better the item the money you will recive)
B) completing tasks or jobs. Another player may need help building or mining and if someone helps that player maybe they will give them money?
C)special events. You can place bets on who is going to win in fights, or you can enter the lottery and have a chance at wining the big prize!
With money a player can buy items from the shop, buy a home in the town centre or use it to gain workers!

Rules of the server.
You will see the full list of rules when you arrive, but our main rule is: have fun and let others have fun to!
In the server we will use a 3 strike sytem: this means everytime you break a rule you will gain a strike depending on the seriousness of the crime. For minor crimes you may just be asked to pay a fine or have to work without pay for a while. For more serious crimes you gain a strike and/or sent to jail. Jail is an area where you cant get out where All you can do is wait. Again depending on the seriousness of the crime depends on your sentence you could be in jail for 10mins or 1 hour! (NOTE) this means game time eg if you have a sentence of 1 hour in jail you cant log of for 1 hour, you need to spend the whole hour in the game.

Thank you for reading! We hope you will have a fun time on our server! =) Note:The spawn area is a bit laggy but once you get away from it the lagging stops. I am sorry about the website, I am still in the process of designing our proper one!</description>

      <description>Welcome to Resolution - an SMP server with a community of around 100 players. We decided to reset the server after 4 months, so it was brand new as of 26/03/2011. Feel free to connect to the server and have a look what we've accomplished already!

If you do decide to join us, you just have to create a whitelist application on our forums at minecraft.resolve.me.uk

We have a great team of moderators who are always at hand to help with any issues you may have, and a vibrant community of very keen builders who regularly convene on teamspeak for group projects and builds.

Our server has its own economy with both global and local shops, which is tied in heavily to our area and chest protection system - you'll soon be able to sell or rent your houses on the open market to other players!

We have powerful server hardware, running on 2 cores of an i9 720, with 4GB of RAM on a 100mbit connection in West Europe. We have lots of players from different timezones, so the server is never empty!

If you're keen on joining a community of friendly players with a proven history of some incredible creations, then why not pop along and have a look! All the details are on our forums at http://minecraft.resolve.me.uk/</description>

brand spankin new map. lots of cool features like rpg. Only grief protection is registration...hopefully we can get a good following to build a nice city worthy of grief protection because currently there is nothing to protect. if you want build rights just shoot your in game name on the facebook group at http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_197760316913631 or email andrews91@yahoo.com and i will do my best to act quickly. during the week the server wont be up before 4 central time because i have class, bring your friends.

looking for cool people to be mods right now they get a few exclusive commands like home and sorting inventory. ...this is just a test to see if i can start a good server. enjoy!</description>

      <description>Grandeur is a PvP server focused on fun.

Want to relax with friends?
Wage war against your enemies?
Build relations with your allies?

Then this is the server for you. (Obligatory)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rules:
- No griefing. Understandably, this is a Faction server where PvP is bound to happen. However, please don't purposefully destroy your enemy's house. This does not include stealing from their chests. It's their fault if they didn't lock it.

- Do not talk back to any admin. They are there to help maintain a friendly server.
If you have a problem with one of our admins, please e-mail your issue to grandeursupport@live.com.

- Do not under any circumstances kill people at the starter island or modify it in any way.

- Racism and homophobia: I'm all for a little joke here and there, but please keep it to a minimum. In the end, it's up to the admin to decide if you've been expressing yourself too much. Bad-language is whole-heartedly accepted. We all do it.

- No cheating. If you're caught you will be perma'd. None of the admins cheat on this server and neither should you.</description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

You can also use &lt;b&gt;play.dangazzm.com&lt;/b&gt; to connect through your client.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

This server runs a mod called Dwarfcraft, which sets players at poor skill levels at the beggining and makes it very hard to do everything on just one character. Such as leveling all your skills to the max level. IT CAN BE DONE but will take entirely too long to be practical. The reason for this is to try and funnel people into making towns with each other and choosing different skills. For example the town wants bricks for roads and such, everyone pools together to increase a single person that is designated brickmaker for the town. Making both resources more valuable than other servers, and making it so that making a huge building that you can be proud of is a team effort and will leave you satisfied when complete.
&lt;br /&gt;

Also there is only about 10 of the nearly 30 skill trainers on the map right now and they only train to level 5. To attract higher level trainers players will need to band together and make an extravagant house that would attract a master trainer. Having master trainers in your town is both a huge perk and bragging rights.
&lt;br /&gt;

Not only is there the interaction of showing off what you built that is centered around, wood cutting or swordsman skills. But the community that you and your friends build with towny involved. You still keep your freedom to build and do anything anywhere but Towny gives you a place to regen health, relax, bring trainers to, and gives you more of a sense of purpose.
&lt;br /&gt;
We are very much so open to suggestions as long as everyone likes them, its all about the players after all they are the ones that play it right?</description>

      <description>http://elysium-craft.info/

This server offers a lot of great plugins, while retaining the original Minecraft feel. Featuring a full economy system using iConomy, players can set up shops, hunt monsters for cash, or put bounties on their enemies. A small fee will let crafters warp to the nether, where the profitable (but dangerous!) ghasts float.

mcMMO adds an RPG-like feel, allowing players to level up their skills in mining, repair(!), woodcutting, unarmed, herbalism, excavation, archery, swords, axes and acrobatics. Many of these include activatable abilities, as well as passive boots (crit chance on axes, double drop chance on mining, etc.) Your power level boosts your default regeneration rate.
MCStats2 provides real-time stats for the web page, along with the mcMMO stats.

A map on the web page updates in real time, including player positions, both in the world and the nether. But if you want to hide, you can make yourself invisible on the map.

At night, the hunt begins! Players compete to get the most monster kills. When the sun rises, the one with the most points gets a reward. (MonsterHunter plugin)

Last but not least, Elysium includes the Towny plugin, which allows players to start their own towns where buildings are protected, monsters don&#8217;t spawn and pvp is off. Towns can band together to form nations and declare war on each other.

The first 50 players who are white-listed get a free 500 Big Ones to start, and the first 10 towns will be free (pending approval)! All players after the first 50 will receive the default amount of 100 Big Ones, which is still enough to pick up equipment at the starting town, Athens.

Big Ones are easy to pick up by killing monsters or selling ingots at the Currency Exchange.</description>

      <description>Welcome fellow crafters! This server is open to anyone who wants to join! The society is separated into 3 factions, each will compete for prizes in the occasional contest. Otherwise its about building in and around the city. The city has an inner and an outer courtyard, the latter being open to building. Outside the walls of the outer courtyard, things get a little wild... As with any society there are rules, they are as follows; No: killing another player inside the city. No: destroying buildings within the city. No: griefing. NO FOUL LANGUAGE. Otherwise, this server is very laid back, oh and their are job openings inside! come try it out!</description>

      <description>Welcome to Minefields, a free for all land. Find a safe area and stick to it, because you wont last long in spawn. Escape the beginning, and you might just have a chance. Survival is dependent on your skill and will to survive. Team up or go alone, because the fangs of the feral spiders are just as deadly as a friend's axe through your back. Stay wary, for the land is a battlefield that has seen no use. Machines of war and deadly traps lace the world adding to the danger. Beware the mines!

      <description>The MCD or Minecraft Dominion is a relatively new server and has been up little less then three months. We've gotten quite a few regulars (I mean we been private sense the game broke while we waited for bukkit and we didn't really loose many players) and we use bukkit and a a lot of protection mods! We also offer multi maps. What this means is we have a survival and a nether along with a creative map. Note, Survival/Nether share there inventory where as the creative map does not. This keeps items gained in creative out of the survival map.</description>

Our server runs on a Macbook Pro dual-core which lives in my Living Room. It is hooked up to an AT&amp;T Uverse fiber channel line which gives my 3 Mbit upload speeds, and 32 Mbit download. It's not super-fast (it limits us to around 9 users at once), but it works.  

I'm running a basic SMP server with the Bukkit architecture allowing me to install plug-ins. Here's a list of the current plug-ins that are installed (this list may change form time to time):

Border Guard Lite

iZone (zMod)

Craftbook

Permissions

iChat

Minecart Mania

WorldEdit

PLG Essentials

Stargate

Worldguard

Click on the links to learn how to use them. I hope they work. Email me if they do not. I'll try to fix them as soon as possible.

Thank you,

      <description>No Whitelist. Fun, pure survival server. 
Towny, IConomy, and BetterShop are being used, as well as many other plugins. 

The server has anti- griefer methods, with fire and tnt turned off. You can also instantly create a free town (Towny Plugin) which will give you a 16x16 area in which only you can build. (Additional plots of land will cost money, or "Skots") 

The server has a friendly community, and is just beginning to expand. 

The server admin is MacAttack_V5, or "Scott". 
We use BroHoster to host our minecraft server.</description>

YOU NEED TO HAVE LOGMEIN HAMACHI2

The server runs on a home computer, and is up most weekday evenings from 5-9 GMT. Weekends vary.
We have no mods, becuase we use the official server software.
There are 6 avaliable places, becuase we want a small community that we trust. =)
So please take the time to visit the site, and apply if you like what you see.

(The site is a work in progress)

After all. It is just a game so lets try to have some fun and make some friends here and there if possible. Anyone may join OurCraft even to just try it out. If you like playing on OurCraft and wish to become a known and respected member of our community feel free to sign up and post on our forums. I will always keep an eye out for active members in both forums and in game to help moderate gameplay. Any donations are extremely appreciated.

      <description>-24/7- Read the Forum Thread it has import info on it!

Pretty ruleless, just go by that town's laws, so if you're in the spawn City, follow the laws, if you're in some other town, follow it's laws.

Universal Laws-
1. No breaking gates
2. No stealing static parts of buildings(chests,torches,workbenches,cobble,wood etc.)
3. Alliances are a good thing.

      <description>WELCOME TO VIEWCRAFT!

ViewCraft was created by DCRThinnes and Josgoo and is now run by them. There is no whitelist for ViewCraft, and you can build anywhere as long as it does not obstruct or destroy the spawn neighborhood, where you may also rent/purchase a pre-built home. The world is fairly empty as of now, except for the spawn town. DCRThinnes and Josgoo are willing to help and/or assist you, even if you are a total noob! We are occasionally experiencing minor connection timeout problems, but we are hard at work to fix the problem and have a strong lead as to why this problem is occuring. So head on down to ViewCraft and build crap!!

      <description>CURRENTLY NOT WHITELISTED!!!!

Depending on the people that join I may leave it open to the public, haven't decided yet.
-------------------------------------------------------
Delo's Building Server is a UK based Minecraft Building server running on a high spec gaming computer (3.2GHz Quad Core i7, 6GB of RAM with more coming) you can come on and build to your hearts content. Build what you like! I am aiming for a small community of players with the same mindset, so a town would be nice. It has an active admin (myself) and active moderators too.
-------------------------------------------------------
There are various plugins in use to help with building and also security plugins to ensure your creations are safe!
You can find a full plugin list over on the website: www.thecynicalpala.com/minecraft.php

Any questions? Leave a comment here or email me: delo@thecynicalpala.com</description>

      <description>PvP is on and so are monsters, and animals. Griefers will be banned. Op status is required to build so ask to be an op when you join for the first time. The server is up usually from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m.. I can't keep it up longer than that, because I go to school. Also, the world seed is "floating islands" without the quotes. So basically, just ask for op status, have fun, and respect other people's buildings :).</description>

      <description>1. NO GRIEFING (The reason I put this up is because THERE ARE SOME IDIOTS WHO HAVE NO COMMON SENSE)

2. NO STEALING (Don't take anything from chests, or if someone gets killed by mobs give them their stuff back)

3. NO TROLLING (Don't just be mean and make people mad for fun, only do this if they talk bad about someone good, or if they are a troll (trolls be prepared to be trolled &gt;:D))

4. Obey the Owner, Admins, and Mods, or be banned.

5. To become a mod you must have played on the server for at least a week, and the owners must know who you are.

6. Admins or Mods may not abuse their powers, if any of them do, report them to the Owner, Xenoclaws

----- Admins/Mods may not: ban people for fun, give away a bunch of free stuff for people (only something small thy really need, like some food if they have 1 or 2 hearts left), troll/flame innocent players, or spam the area with loads of spawned blocks.

Illegal Items: TNT, Flint &amp; and Steel

      <description>IP: elosk.upstreamgaming.com
Virtual Private Server - No Lag
Uptime: 24/7
Slots: 40
Mode: SMP

THIS IS A PVP-CONCENTRATED SERVER! OF COURSE, BUILDING PROJECTS ARE ENCOURAGED, BUT PLEASE DON'T CRY AND RAGE IF YOU GET KILLED RANDOMLY!

Overview

Welcome to Elosk's Survival Server! We are a brand new, SMP server that encourages PvP, but also allows creative building and fun PvE! That means you better go make a house/base, mine some minerals, make weapons, make friends, and KILL! We have a very friendly community, active moderators, and many plugins that help make this server even more fun! We are also open to community suggestions, and try to show as much respect to people as possible.

Features

24/7 - Server will be up 24 hours a day, 7 days a week! Besides server updates, hardware upgrades, etc., you won't miss any of the action!
No Whitelist - We are a friendly community that invites everyone to come play with us! Of course, if there are griefers, we will definitely treat them with what they deserve!
Events - We will have at least one event per week. There is an arena made specifically for events, and you may win precious items and privileges through them!
Large Map - The map is 4000x4000 squares. Spawn is located at (0,65,0). This give you a lot of area to build towns, raise fortresses, and battle!
PvPvE - You are allowed to kill anyone at anytime, as long as you are not in a safe zone. There are only 9 safe zones on this server (spawn, corners, and sides). Also, mobs are enabled, so watch your back for creepers at all times!
Chest Protection - You do not have to worry about losing everything when you or people stealing from you, You can protect your chests with a password!
No Buckets, Flint and Steel, or TnT - Grief items have been banned! You may still ask a moderator or admin for water and lava if needed.
Jail - We jail douchebags.
Party System - You may request to create a party/clan and speak through party chat while on raids! Make clans, and dominate the competition with combined bases!
Big Brother - This server runs Big Brother. All actions and commands will be logged, and griefers will be found and banned.
Mumble Chat Server - Coming Soon!
Donators - Coming soon! Once it is set up, Donators will have special perks!

Rules

1. No griefing.
2. No hacking/cheating.
3. No spamming.
4. No 1x1 towers!

PLEASE READ! PLEASE READ! PLEASE READ! PLEASE READ! PLEASE READ! PLEASE READ!

General Rules


1. NO GRIEFING! This is the number one rule in the server. Griefing includes destroying peoples' creations without permission, building in peoples' bases without permission, 1x1 random towers, destroying the environment with random digging or placing, etc. If something is unsure to you, ask an admin or moderator before acting.
2. RESPECT THE ADMIN/MODERATOR! We try our best to be as fair as possible, and as nice as possible. Please do the same with us.
3. No spamming chat. Please, it is just annoying.
4. No racism, sexism, or hate speech; there are no exceptions to this.
5. Don't be a dick! To those who don't know what this means, being a dick includes killing unarmed players excessively without reason. If you PvP, you should at least have a reason for PvP, like gaining items. You won't be banned for being a dick, but you might be jailed or "messed around" with :)
6. No abusing protection systems, such as making walls with locked chests that don't get destroyed.
7. No hacking or abusing 3rd party programs to help cheat the game.
8. No offensive skins.
9. You may take items from another player's chest if their chest is unlocked. If you don't have the time to read the command list and realize there is chest-locking, you deserve it.

(This applies to everyone, including non-PvPers. Just putting these in a separate rule category for organization)

1. Your base must be easily accessible to everyone without block breaking. That means iron doors with a one-way lever on the inside ARE NOT ALLOWED. If you have a wooden door, though, people MUST ENTER from that wooden door.
2. You MAY NOT break the walls of a base or house to get to another player. Basically, you cannot grief to get to another player. This is only acceptable if they have built non-functioning blocks completely enclosing themselves, but always look for another entrance first.
3. If you accidentally break something in someone's house, you MUST REPLACE IT ASAP.
4. WARNING: Minecraft will sometimes make people invisible. These people will reappear if you re-log in. Re-log in often because you will not be reimbursed if you die from an invisible person.
5. No pushing other players out of the safe zone. You also may not attack someone out of the safe zone from the safe zone. This is abusing safe zone protection.
6. No base-camping or brute-force takeovers of other peoples' base. You may wait in someones base to kill them once, but that should be about the only time. They would probably have no items by the time they come back, so please, don't be a dick.
7. Spawn camping is not allowed. What qualifies as spawn camping is continuously killing UNARMED PLAYERS who aren't attacking when they leave spawn. Let them build, please.

We are trying to make a Role Playing Community and after some time we will add some mods that makes role playing easier and alot more fun. Our build style is Medieval/Pre-Medieval. We focus on making a role-playing experience seen in games like The Elder Scrolls. Although this ain't easy, we will still try to reach that goal. 
One thing that we focus on is anti grief. Griefing will not be overlooked, and it will result in ban. This server runs MCBans.

      <description>Hi,
hier ist mein erster &#246;ffentlicher Minecraft Server&#176;
Ich habe schon viel (privat) mit meinen Freunden dran gebastelt und er hat bisher eine sch&#246;ne Map.
Wichtig: Die Map ist Flatgrass und ihr k&#246;nnt euch (mit Geld) Materialien kaufen.

ABER BITTE: Erst die Regeln lesen! Dann von einem Admin Bau-Rechte bekommen und erst dann bauen!
Im Admin Haus bekomt ihr von einem Admin ein Starter-Kit mit R&#252;stung und Pickaxe und einigen Materialien (Holz, Cobble, Chest) oder gebt ein /kits

W&#252;nsche euch viel Spa&#223;!!

      <description>This server is pretty well laid back, as long as you follow the rules.  For example, you may build whatever you want as long as it is not offensive and not an eyesore.  Also, please refrain from greifing anything, because that is grounds for an instant ban.  You are able to build from the second you come on.  We have very friendly mods on, and they will be glad to help you.  Do not go in anybody else's house unless invited in, and do not ask for materials.  If you need, we can give you access to a public mine.  Do not ask for kits, or to be an OP.  We will deem you an OP if necessary, but we have enough for now...</description>

Plugins Installed:
Bukkit
Worldguard - firespread off, Creeper nerfed and we monitor certain items to catch griefers
iConomy - use coins to trade in game
Towny - build your own towns and community
iConomyChestShop - Sell and Buy items ingame
LWC - Secure your chests

Additonal info:
citizenship is given after 3-5 days depending on user activity.
Mobs are on, but creeper explosions off.
Firespread off

Feel free to join and play. 83.222.240.184:27265

Type /spawn and of course /help when you join and get useful info on the server! You can also view our map on our website.

We do have donator options as we hope one day to expand enough to have multiple nations and wars. This is in no way mandatory and we have tried to not let this affect the gameplay of non-donators.

Cheers

      <description>CommunityCraft is a great community server! (Latest Beta 1.4)

We have a great staff of Admins and Moderators. We have a number of cities in which you can journey to and live in or live on your own in the wilderness.

Groups We Currently Have:
-Default (Self-Explanatory)
-Builder (Able to spawn block (not items) and build in cities)
-Hunter (Access to the hunters guild for free hunting items, and gets more of a reward for killing mobs)
-Moderator (Watches the server)
-SemiAdmin (Watches the server better)
-Admin (Me)

Features:
-Essentials: Basic Essentials. Locked Chests. Shops.
-GroupManager: Makes groups for the server.
-iConomy: In game currency used to purchase items from shops. Coins rewarded for doing quests and killing mobs.
-mcMMO: Level up system.
-uQuest: Gives you quests to perform for rewards.
-WorldGuard: Protects cities from building (and griefing) and disables PvP in cities.
-WorldEdit: For admins for faster building/clearing.
-CivilizedSpawn: Monsters don't spawn in cities.
-SpawnList: Prevents people from spawning items (not blocks) for fairer play.

In addition, griefing is practically impossible with WorldGuard, Essentials and Spawnlist. Theres no TNT, Fire, Lava, etc. You can feel safe on our server.

Our server is not Whitelisted and is 24/7 so feel free to join any time!

CommunityCraft is driven by the community in which anyone can feel free to do as they please (except grief) and have fun!

Join Today!

      <description>This is a server where protection mods have not yet been enabled and some mods are still being tested. 

We are running the Wormhole/Stargate mod and craftbook. Thats right. You can create bridges and gates! and with the newest update you can use redstone with them. 

The server is up to 20 slots right now but i can go bigger if i have to.

(Edit): Craftbook is out of service because it needs to update.... Worldguard will be enabled AS SOON AS IT UPDATES! Cant wait to get those protections in!! Yeah!!

HAVE FUN! LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING YOU JOIN US IN OUR SERVER!

Rules: Not too many.

-No excessive killing for any reason. Try and keep fun for all.
-Absolutely NO GREIFING. Greifers get banned on the spot no matter what level of importance you are to the server. And there is absolutely no tolerance for it.
-Try and be nice and helpful to others. 
-I dont want to go through the trouble of adding protection mods and dealing with the hassle of adding them so if i feel you arent following rules of privacy or protections ill jail/ban.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the WestCoast Minecraft  Server (WCMS) Gaming Server
Current IP address is 50.53.115.63. Come join the the growing community

 

Current Server Rules:

Mine a tree... replant 2 please
No Greifing... you will be banned.
No floating building. Has to look natural
More to come.....

 

This is a beutifual map called Eve. First map for this server. On day one we had our first forest fire. As you can see from the pics.

 

I host this server in Oregon. For the least amount of lag pick this server if you want to game with westcoast players.IE. Oregon, Cali, Washingtion 

Currently this is a survival server going to be set to hard. There is no cheating, no kits no nothing. You make it or die.

This will soon be on a dedicated server, however for now I run it on my supercomputer.

 

Let me know what you think. Come join the community.

 

BTW. No the world was not griefed. That was a natural forest fire that happen because of how the world was created with so many tree and lava in the right place.

      <description>- you can build wherever you want in the wilderness, but to build in a town the owner of the town must allow it.

- When your done building your house or town then you can request protection so no one can break in, grief , or steal your items.

- you can get a shop permit by request one on permit page. ( a shop permit can be anything, a hotel permit, or any type of business. ) 

- you can use any currency you want. ( i think iron would be best choice )

- lockable chests
- no fall damage
- no creeper explosions
- death notifier
- /list

- more on website

Description: There are no set rules where to and not to build. It's pure freedom as long as you follow the rules below. Players have the free will to create towns and stores. No permissions is needed to do so. We encourage
our players to be as creative as can be when playing on our server :).

Rules
------

1.) Griefing is not permitted unless the user permitted through typed words that the griefer was allowed to grief their property.
2.) PVP is only permitted as long as both PVPer's agree to this action through typed consent. PvP however, is always flagged on the world labeled Atticus.
4.) Wars are allowed on the world labled Atticus. To start a battle however, at least 3 members of an opposing faction must be online.
3.) Stealing from anyone (stores are considered people) will result in insta ban on the world labled world. Stealing on Atticus is allowed.
4.) Admins will only be allowed to spawn tools, nothing else. So if you die by a freak accident, only tools are allowed to be respawned.
Respawned items for a user can only take place once every two days.
5.) To become a mod or admin, you must come into teamspeak and talk with all of us, and also join The Atticus Gaming community. Go to the forums link above and go to applications category and click the Atticus Application forum.
6.) No external mods may be used unless you're at an Enshrine rank+. This includes all xray mods/texture packs and flying mods.

The Atticus Survival is a great way to have fun or waste time! Our goal is set out to satisfy everyone's needs to the best of our abilities. Our server contains NO WHITELIST! We are purely public to the eye. We do host a private minecraft server as well, but that is only for the dedicated members to The Atticus community.

The Atticus Gaming is a gaming community who's set goal is to bring gamers, like you and I, together.
We contain sections that are from the casual gamer to the hardcore enthusiast. We do have a
competitive MMO section, mainly for the upcoming MMO called RIFT, that has guilds named Atticus.
Along the lines of other competitive parts, the competitive game we play would include Left 4 Dead 1 and 2,
Battlefield series, SWAT 4, CSS, FEAR series, and etc. Our community does host other game servers as well.

We are always looking for more people to join our community as a whole. To do so, go to http://forums.7ag.me and go to the "Applications" section near the bottom. We hope to see you in our teamspeak sometime :).

      <description>25 slots - SMP - Craftbukkit - WorldGuard - Wilderness - Stargates - Nether

A world in development, this is a rather new world with plenty of space to settle down and build ambitious projects, or join in and help others on their projects.

We have, among many other nice and interesting builds, a real scale model of the RMS Titanic, built by the server owner himself.

This server offers a very strong anti-griefing protection, which also limits free building within 1250x1250 in all directions from Ground Zero (bit away from spawn). PvP is also restricted within this protected region, and it offers peace with no danger from monsters inside the protected regions. Active Admins and Moderators are available nearly all the time, if help is needed or for questions, and they may also grant you protected property and give you access to build in it.

This world also has a free-for-all Wilderness regions outside the build-protected region, where nothing is restricted - not even PvP! But, we permanently ban any griefers or thieves on sight. If any damage is done to property, Admins and Mods will restore the area from backups in less than a minute.</description>

      <name>CubeCraft: The Minecraft Art Gallery! Freebuild | Creative | Bukkit | Unique | Art | Submit | mineOS</name>
      <description>Minecraft is a highly creative platform in which the boundaries of what you can do is limited only by your imagination...and what version you are running. :) We have seen some amazingly creative things done in Minecraft and sought to create a place where everything of this sort could be viewed. That's why we've created Cube Craft Gallery. Ours is a server in which we display chosen artwork for the public at large to see.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Connect to gallery.cubecraft.org and take a look around!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/a/cubecraft.org/leaf?id=0B7_uVlbjeaXoMGZkMWFlZDAtZmRmZS00MzE5LWIwZDEtZTczZjY1YWE2MmM2&amp;sort=name&amp;layout=list&amp;num=50"&gt;We suggest using our texture pack!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Currently, the server is running and our facilities are built, but we do not have much work to fill it. If you have something you've made in minecraft you'd like for us to consider for display, we'd love to take a look! We are looking for:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
-Sculpture (large and small)&lt;br&gt;
-Architecture&lt;br&gt;
-Installation works&lt;br&gt;
-Sound pieces&lt;br&gt;
-Pixel art&lt;br&gt;
-Performance art&lt;br&gt;
-Paintings&lt;br&gt;
-Redstone contraptions&lt;br&gt;
-practically anything else&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you are interested, please visit &lt;a href="www.cubecraft.org"&gt;our website!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Our server currently runs a modified version of &lt;a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?p=1753607"&gt;Moderncraft texture pack.&lt;/a&gt; You can download our version below to see what your work might look like once added to our server.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/a/cubecraft.org/leaf?id=0B7_uVlbjeaXoMGZkMWFlZDAtZmRmZS00MzE5LWIwZDEtZTczZjY1YWE2MmM2&amp;sort=name&amp;layout=list&amp;num=50"&gt;Download our Texture Pack!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We are currently working on streamlining the submission process, putting information about the server online, and making Cube Craft Gallery a legitimate art gallery at large. Our website is under construction, and should be up and running within a week or so. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, Please let us know! Thank you for your time, and we look forward to hearing from you!</description>

      <description>NO RULES SERVER! 75 SLOTS!

There is a 256 block wide safe area at spawn. Outside this area is a full blown free for all!

No client side modifications that give you an unfair advantage (fly/speed/clear textures) or you will be banned indefinitely.
This (obviously) includes inventory editors and duping.

I should probably also note that the server runs quite a few plugins I developed myself to allow staff to monitor almost every aspect of the server. We ban a lot of people every day and you will be one of them if you try and break the rules. So rather than ruining other peoples fun and wasting our staffs time join us in the fun and follow the rules.

      <description>Hey guys, I decided to make a proper survival multiplayer server that feels like the real deal, aka. a server that has all the features that single player has but does not have any additional mods. I like to have the challenge of collecting all the materials for building while trying to dodge the mobs and falling into the lava pits.

      <description>Hello, this is a server run by myself, Surfaman, and my close friend Syncitywolf. this is primarily a furry server, but all are free to play. A forewarning though, furrys will be in this server, if you do not wish to associate yourself with them, then do not join. This server has a whitelist, so contact me before you join at headstrong623@gmail.com so i can add you to the whitelist. we have simple rules here. do not grief. griefing can easily result in a temporary, to permanent ban. no harrassment. there will  be warnings for this, but if you ignore them, you can earn bans. do not exchange with premium currency with anyone but an admin. doing so, is a bannable offense for both partys. there will be a premium currency that will be implimented. it can only be obtained by donating to the server. with the premium currency, you can buy access to the vip area, and buy building plots inside it. the vip area is all but grief proof. the only griefers that can easily get in by donating to the server first. if we find that a vip is griefing, they will get in trouble just like others. and if a perma ban is earned, there will be no refunds for any donations given. the exact currency and the value of it is still under debate with me and Syn. (likely slimeballs, and a dime each ;))</description>

What we are about:

We are a group of gamers bringing you a great RP/survival experience. We have economy, guilds, towns, quests, npcs and just about anything else. When you spawn you are in a tutorial area. Here you will learn about the server, and what it is all about. You will get a review on guilds, server features, rules, npcs, quests, and skills. Make sure to grab a book when you spawn.


Quests &amp; Npcs:

A cool feature of our server is quests and npcs. Quest is a great way to get items and money. There are many npcs giving quests all over Dar you just need the book you grabbed from the spawn tutorial to talk to them. There are also some npcs that anyone can trade with in the Trading Tower. You can turn in cobblestone for iron ingots and such!

Guilds:

The coolest feature are guilds. There are three guilds, trading, crafting and magic. Each have their own special abilities that make them stand out. None are alike. There are 6 ranks or tiers to each guild that get progressively harder to rank up. The first rank of each guild cost 2000 Raash (our currency) and 1 leaf. Leaves can be bought from already ranked players and through /kits. Only members who have joined a guild will get /kits.

To join a guild at first you must trade with other players or sell your items to a trader.

Trading Guild

The Trading Guild is my personal favorite guild. They are the base of the economy of the server and what's bringing and distribute all the money throughout the server. The have access to the /shop command are able to buy and sell items to the Trading Tower or to any personal shop that another trader has set up. If you want to join this guild the Trading Master can be found in the Trading Tower, the largest building in Dar.

Ranks:
Rank one: Crier
Rank two: Vendor
Rank three: Salesman
Rank four: Shopkeeper
Rank five: Monger
Rank six: Trade-Master

Detailed information here.

Crafting Guild

The Crafting Guild has the ability to make portals, lot protections, gates, bridges, elevators, doors, ICs and just about everything else that involves a sign. A crafter is the best person to go to if want a special instillation or a protection for you house. Remember they will charge you.

Ranks:
Rank one: Weaver
Rank two: Cobbler
Rank three: Mason
Rank four: Carpenter
Rank five: Artisan
Rank six: Craft-Master

Detailed information here.

Magic Guild

The Magic Guild has access to the /cast command are able to cast special spells. Spells include setting a home point and reverting to it with /cast mark and /cast recall. Magicians are the only guild that are able to teleport to other players. Magicians can be used as taxis and can teleport you to locations such as Dar for a fee. They also have many advanced spells at later levels that can help you make money.

Ranks:
Rank one: Evoker
Rank two: Conjurer
Rank three: Shaman
Rank four: Warlock
Rank five: Wizard
Rank six: Arch-Mage

Detailed information here.

Economy

Economy is the base of the server, with a currency called Raash. When you spawn you will only have 150 Raash, use it wisely. Raash is used to trade, get teleports, and rank up in guilds. Money can be accessed through the /money command. To earn money when you first join I recommend doing quests located throughout Dar(main city). By the end of doing all or most of the quests you will have enough money to join a guild and plenty of spoils! Also selling your minerals from mining to a trader is a great way to make money.


Craftbook

Craftbook is a great plugin that allows a crafter to make gates, bridges, doors, cauldrons and elevators. They can also make complex things with redstone. Craftbook also powers the train stations located all throughout the world that link towns and Dar together.


Skills

There are three skills you can rank up in, farming, mining and woodcutting. There are 99 ranks in each skill and is based off of the Runescape XP. Each mined material yields one XP. As you rank up you gain a chance of a double drop and at later levels triple and quad drops.

Living and building areas

The world is divided into three parts. Dar(main city), towns, and the wild. Dar is the area where the portal from the spawn tutorial area takes you. This is where you can buy lots from an admin(completely protected) and where most quests and npcs are located. Outside of Dar is the wild and makes up most of the world. The wild is free build but all rules still apply. If you need your house protected contact a crafter. Towns are player run and are also protected from griefers. If you want to join a town you must talk to the mayor of that particular town.

Limbo

Limbo is an area located past the 2000 block mark (the total map barrier is 3500 blocks) that has pvp always on. You don't know when you enter it unless you check your coordinates (F3) and in the future it will auto refresh every week to keep resources fresh in the world. That means you shouldn't build here unless you want it to disappear in the future.

Griefing Detection

With the BigBrother plugin, we are able to find out who griefed your house! It is as simple as standing within 5 blocks of the grief and typing /bbhere. Then take a screen shot of what the /bbhere command spits out and post it here http://www.justgamers.org/f13-ban-appeals-and-requests. One of the admins will read the post and deal the correct punishment to the player.

So How Do I Join?

The great thing about our server that it has no whitelist! All ranking up is done in-game through npcs and is explained when you join. Just make sure to talk to the npc guide and accept his quest if you want build permissions!

      <description>1. No Griefing
Griefing, is the act of placing blocks, removing blocks, adding water or lava, or starting fires, causing grief among the other users of the server. This means that breaking a glass block in a window and walking on is known as griefing.

2. No Stealing
Stealing consists of taking items or blocks from another person or another person's property. If you are caught and or we check our chest logs to find you were stealing out of a chest, you will be banned immediately without hesitation.

3. Chat Behavior
Profanity is tolerated, abuse or harrassment of other players is not. Harassing other players about their family, or how they act inside of our server will in fact get you banned. We don't care what you talk about, just don't fuck around too much. Spamming the chat will not get anything done, so don't try it. Global chat has a LOT of people in it most of the time, and you SAYING THINGS LIKE THIS, can be seen as annoyance.

4. Illegal Materials
TNT, Lava Buckets, and Lava.

5. Listen to your Peers
Please respect other people's claims and do not build on their property. If they ask you to leave, do so. If you do not leave that user can feel free to contact an admin and they will place that user extremely far away, most likely the spawn.

6. Items
Giving away blocks as a donator is strictly illegal on our server. We Will check our logs and ban you if you are doing such a thing.</description>

      <name>The World of Hatu</name>
      <description>"The World of Hatu" is a new server looking for some cool people to help us build up an awesome world. This is, first and foremost, a survival server. This means mobs are turned on and you will not be allowed to spawn any items, nor should you expect admins to spawn items for you.



The theme for this server is medieval and fantasy. This includes any architecture types similar to the middle ages and renaissance periods. Anything seemingly "magical" is also welcome. 



Some of our server's features:

- Area protection (including chest protection)

- Portal gates (admin-created gates that can warp you to other parts of the world)

- Graveyard system (when you die, you will respawn at the nearest graveyard)

- PvP toggle (decide for yourself if you want to PvP or not)

- Certain anti-griefing (and disaster prevention) measures

- A connected IRC channel

- A custom economy system



To join the server you will need to apply on the forum thread. Please read the information on the thread before applying!</description>

      <name>Wingnut's Wicked Minecraft Server</name>
      <description>The server is very friendly and all have commented that Wingnut's Wicked Minecraft Server is by far the best server they have every connected to. I hope that as the server grows this will continue. At the moment we only have a few mods to avoid Griefing but in future our community may grow beyond vanilla SMP and as a community we will decide which mods we would like to add.

We have a no tolerance policy on greifers and they are kick banned permanently on the first offense. There are anti greifing plugins in place to combat this.

Please feel free to come and join us and say hello!</description>

      <name>0xF 1.3 Survival Server [RAMdisk] [Cities] [NPCs] [Nether] [Economy] [Shops] [Trading] [US]</name>
      <description>&lt;br /&gt;
0xF is hosting this public Survival server at mc.0xf.org.  The server is a dedicated box and is located in the Central US.  You are free to wander out into the wilderness, or come and build with us in one of our many cities!   This server is still new and under development, but is still very much functional.  We have tried to do everything we can without spawning materials.  Some users have opted to have flat areas for their cities cuboided, but this is frowned upon.  Some of the later roads have been cuboided in, but most of the server infrastructure is hand-built with hand-gathered materials.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We have an in-game economy and a couple of server stores set up, and encourage users to set up their own stores.  We use the EssentialsEco sign trading mod to facilitate this.  Trades can be done with items, gold or in-game money.  $100 of in-game cash will always be equal to one gold bar.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We have a Vent server (vent.0xf.org:8050), dynmap (&lt;a href='http://mc.0xf.org:8000/'&gt;http://mc.0xf.org:8000/&lt;/a&gt;), a Pigmap (&lt;a href='http://web.0xf.org/maps/world/'&gt;http://web.0xf.org/maps/world/&lt;/a&gt;), an IRC channel (#0xF on irc.esper.net), and many more features external to the game!  We are also working on getting our forums (&lt;a href='http://forums.0xf.org/'&gt;http://forums.0xf.org/&lt;/a&gt;) and Wiki set up.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All worlds on this server are run from a RAMdisk and backed up ever half hour.  At any given point, we have access to at hourly backups for the past 24 hours and daily backups indefinitely.  I am a real Linux system admin who takes data loss very seriously.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I see this server as a refuge for those fleeing from the immaturity and instability of most of the Minecraft servers out there.  To this effect, we will not hesistate to deal with immature people.  Don't worry, you'll still have to really do something stupid to get banned. We also will not spawn materials, tools, etc for users.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This server currently has three admins and four mods.  We are looking for more mods to assist with protections, help tickets, and general server discipline.  Mods on this server are not expected to be performing their duties 100% of the time they are on the server; we want mods to be able to play also.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We do accept donations, and will have instant donor rewards set up soon.  More information on that to come.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We use WorldGuard for protection.  </description>

      <description>Lost Shard's primary mod is a custom RPG mod written from the ground up to roughly approximate the feeling of old-school UO. It has free for all PvP mixed in with land ownership, skills, magic and more. There is a karma system that keeps track of player kills and eventually makes you a murderer and there is a spawn city just for criminals.  

Visit www.lostshard.com for more info including a wiki. 

Very minimal rules basically comes down to no exploiting/hacking and no impersonating staff. Griefing is part of the game, it is a PvP server after all.

Auf dem Server dropen Monster Items.

Absolute Pflicht auf diesem Server ist das kennen der Regeln!

      <name>DomeNET [Factions, NPCx, iConomy] [RP-PvP] [24/7]</name>
      <description>The DomeNET system was established by the Travels before the dawn of our know time.

This system spanned across the Galaxy providing instantaneous travel between hundreds of planets. Now the system has been discovered and there is a new world to be explored.

However, beware of the remaining factions from the Anh-Holo Wars. With the Hologian Faction constantly battling the Anh'Katar there is no telling when you will be dragged into a war zone.

Join us, in exploring this strange new world and help us rebuild that which was left behind.

This will be me and people who donate a large sum of money, not that I am expecting anybody to, and are already admins.)

      <description>[GER] Geistlande ist ein seit dem 05.03.2011 aktiver deutscher Server mit derzeit 32 Slots, der nur durch einige wenige Komfortfunktionen vom Standard-Play abweicht. 

[ENG] Geistlande is a mid-sized (32), slightly modified Standard-Server, 24/7, 1000Mbit connection. Though most Minecrafters will speak german here, international users are welcome. 

...................................................................

Mehrere Br&#252;cken und lange Stra&#223;en f&#252;hren von der Spawn-Insel auf die gro&#223;en Kontinente, wo Bauen und Farmen kaum eingeschr&#228;nkt und noch ausreichend Platz f&#252;r Projekte aller Art vorhanden ist. Wer einen beqeumen Platz gefunden hat und etwas aufbaut, kann dies vom Admin auf Anfrage gro&#223;r&#228;umig protecten lassen. In einer zentral gelegenen Stadt werden dar&#252;ber hinaus laufend Grundst&#252;cke f&#252;r Stadth&#228;user eingerichtet.


Besucht unsere Homepage unter: www.geistlande.de

Der Server ist auch unter mcgeist.de, die Serverkarte unter: http://mcgeist.de:8123 erreichbar. Au&#223;erhalb von Minecraft steht im quakenet der IRC-Channel #mcgeist zur Verf&#252;gung.


Wer einen sympathischen, interessanten und belebten aber noch nicht zugebauten Server mit der Gelegenheit sucht, sich zu "verewigen", ist herzlich auf "Geistlande" eingeladen.

      <description>Welcome to Craftwars townwars. 
Craftwars is a new server, that is focusing on PvP in minecraft.

So, what is 'townwars'?
- Townwars is when you build a city - at a far distance from the spawn - and you gather friends to join your city. Then you fight against other players and cities to become the emperor of Craftwars.

      <description>You're new in town, the world is big, and the local gods chosen pets, the creepers, have decided that is an amazing absolutely nothing you have. Can you make it on your own or will you team up with others of like mind and build a town to stave off the night? Perhaps you have skills as a farmer or engineer? Maybe your a good politician. Whatever the case I'm sure you will find a place, even if it is as a hated and despised raider and brigand.

The Cave is a RP Survival server currently under active development. We are running CraftBukkit and several mods to help with immersion as well as custom work constantly being developed and deployed to make The Cave one of the best Minecraft experiences there are.

      <description>Hallo liebe Minecraftler und Minecraftlerinnen
Wir von KugelHagel.net sind in meheren Spielen vertreten und besitzen auch einige Server, vor einigen Monaten haben wir uns entschlossen uns in MineCraft nieder zu lassen. Wir sind mehr eine Community als ein Clan, wir hei&#223;en gern jeden willkommen der sich ordentlich benimmt und Spa&#223; am Spiel hat.
Einigen von euch d&#252;rfte unser alter hey0 Mod Server bekannt sein, zum start von Bukkit haben wir eine neue Welt gestartet und die Regeln &#252;berarbeitet sowie ein neues Konzept geschrieben. Wir hoffen das euch unser Server gef&#228;lt, wenn nicht k&#246;nnt ihr auch gerne im Forum konstruktive Kritik &#228;u&#223;ern.
Besucht als erstes unsere Website.
Dort erfahrt ihr alles N&#246;tige &#252;ber die Regeln und wie ihr freigeschaltet werdet. Wir verwenden keine Whitelist, also k&#246;nnt ihr einfach mal reinschnuppern
und euch selbst von unserem Server und der Community &#252;berzeugen.
Sobald ihr die Baurechte auf dem Server bekommen habt k&#246;nnt ihr euch auf ein freies Grundst&#252;ck in der Startstadt st&#252;rzen oder einen B&#252;rgermeister von den anderen St&#228;dten nach einen Bauplatz fragen, schaut allerdings erstmal ob das Gel&#228;nde auch niemanden geh&#246;rt (kein Schild=kein Besitzer). Erst ab einer Grundst&#252;cksgr&#246;&#223;e von 50x50 ist die Genehmigung eines Admins/Mods/B&#252;rgermeisters einzuholen. Da wir versuchen realsitisch zu wirken, ist es nicht erlaubt 1x1 T&#252;rme oder Br&#252;cken zu bauen (kurz zum B&#228;umef&#228;llen ist ok, aber danach gleich weg damit).Ihr solltet auch euer Haus Zombiesicher gestalten, nicht das ihr mal von Zombies aus den Schlaf gerissen werdet. 


Was bieten wir euch?
Ihr k&#246;nnt eure Heimat mit einem einfachen Befehl festlegen, wodurch ihr nach eurem Tod dort wiederaufersteht. 
Creeper explodieren bei uns, richten alledings nur beim Spieler und nicht der Umgebung Schaden an.
Eure Herzen regenerieren sich von selbst mit einer Rate von 0,5Herzen/5Sec auf bis zu 5 von 10 Herzen.
Ein Questsystem erm&#246;glicht es euch au&#223;erdem eure Taschen zu f&#252;llen und f&#252;r etwas Abwechslung zu sorgen. 
Wir verwenden iConomy, was f&#252;r euch bedeutet ihr k&#246;nnt sogenannte Craftys sammeln (unsere W&#228;hrung), sei es durch Quests, Monsterjagdt, verkaufen von Edelmetallen oder aber durch den Handel mit anderen Spielern. 
Regelm&#228;&#223;ig werden Events veranstaltet, bei denen ihr z.B. eure Kreativit&#228;t unter Beweis stellen k&#246;nnt, das sch&#246;nste Geb&#228;ude gewinnt und dem Spieler winken tolle Preise.
Durch die Verwendung von CraftBook k&#246;nnt ihr au&#223;erdem Tore/Br&#252;cken/Fahrst&#252;hle bauen, die ihr sogar in eine Redstone Schaltung miteinbeziehen k&#246;nnt.
Auch der Nether ist bei uns angekommen und kann entdeckt werden. NPC Wachen sorgen am Spawn und im Gef&#228;ngnis f&#252;r Ordnung. Ein leicht zu bedienender Shop erm&#246;glicht es euch schwer oder garnicht zug&#228;ngliche Gegent&#228;nde im Handumdrehen f&#252;r einige Craftys zu erwerben.
Unser Tag/Nacht Zyklus betr&#228;gt jeweils 8 Minuten. Wir haben auch Spiele wie z.b. Spleef oder eine Bogenschie&#223;anlage
Ihr k&#246;nnt bei uns Wasser und Lava aus Eimern setzten, zudem wird das Ausbreiten von Feuer vom Server verhindert, somit gibt es keine Infernale Waldbr&#228;nde mehr.
Jeder der bei uns auf den Server spielen m&#246;chte ist auch gern auf unserm TeamSpeak 3 Server gesehen. IP: 62.75.178.79:9987



Was wir von euch verlangen: 
Hier ein Teil unserer Regeln (nur einpaar, die komplette Liste ist auf der Homepage zu finden)
# Allgemeines Benehmen und geistige Reife werden bei uns vorrausgesetzt
# Respektiert die anderen Spieler und deren H&#228;user
# H&#228;user oder Baustellen sind ohne Genehmigung nicht zu betreten
# Keine 1x1 T&#252;rme, Tunnel, L&#246;cher oder Br&#252;cken
# Ab einer Fl&#228;che von 50x50 ist eine Genehmigung erforderlich.
# Das ungefragte Bauen auf fremden Grundst&#252;cken ist verboten!! fragt erst bevor ihr helfen wollt
# Es werden keine Spieler au&#223;erhalb von PVP-Gebieten bzw der Arena get&#246;tet oder ihnen Schaden zugef&#252;gt.
# Truhen sind zu verschlie&#223;en, da es keinen Ersatz bei Diebstahl gibt.
# kein Bugusing, Cheaten oder Griefing (das beinhaltet auch Flug, Speed und x-Ray Mods. Diese werde vom Server erkannt, also versucht es erst garnicht)
# Jedes Griefen f&#252;hrt bei uns unmittelbar zum Bann. Hier sind wir konsequent um Euch ein maximales Spielerlebnis zu gew&#228;hrleisten

      <name>Steve's Medium RolePlay</name>
      <description>My Minecraft server is a RolePlay Only server.
There is no pvp (although it is enabled for obvious reasons), or 'griefing' unless heavily RolePlayed on the person being griefed (which means the person MUST be online for you to rob, kill, steal chests, burn/destroy houses).

You may only spawn items (/give) if you are given permission or if you are even OP.

I run my server off of  bukkit so i have a plugin called Towny (a plugin in which you can make towns and nations and go to war with one another), iConomy (pretty obvious), and a whole bunch of cool plugins to enhance your gaming experience.

I am a very, very fair Admin and so is my Admin team you will only be banned if we see that you deserve the punishment.

If you do decide to join our server you will have to choose a job and  choose a city to live in or make one of your own! 
Here is  a list of some of the jobs we have on our server (some are still being implemented)
~ Farmer
~ Miner
~ Logger
~ Hunter
~ Butcher
~ Guard/Police Officer
~ Servant
If you have anymore ideas please tell me :D

Also, the server doesn't have a high uptime due to the fact that my schedule doesn't allow me to keep my computer on all day and night to host a minecraft server.
The main hours that the server will be online are:
around 4:00 p.m. - 10:30 p.m. on weekdays and depending when i get up on weekends 8:00 a.m. - 11:30 ish p.m. 


The server is NOT ready to be opened to the public yet i'm just posting in advance to get people to see what our server is like and hope they join when it is fully public.

p.s. the ip address is not the real one (server not public yet).

      <description>No rules. Only thing that will get you banned is use of client-side mods (scanner mods, flymods, transparent texture packs, etc.) or other obvious hacks.

Not equipped with bukkit or any such nonsense, see Titans of Minecraft: Civilization (laxop.com:25565) for that.</description>

      <description>A "Vanilla like" smp server. What helps this Vanilla like experience&#8230; No /warp. No /give. (not even for the owner/admins/mods) What is not so Vanilla is&#8230; you can&#8230; /tpa (ask to teleport ) to each other, set your spawn with /home and lock your items with /lwc. You can also set a /home to set your own spawn. I have creeper block damage turned off (so the server does not go to sh** when people don't login and maintain their structures.) I have BigBrother installed so we can find and roll back griefers easy. I have fire spread turned off on wool and wood-planks. A working nether. ( you have to tp to someone to get out! ) 
The server is running on dedicated linux server (all it does is serve minecraft ) and we are running the world in a ram disk&#8230; so things stay pretty snappy.
you have to register at www.goldshoepolish.com/mybb (automatic whitelist )

      <description>This is my mostly private dev box for helping out game.minecrap.net figure out what mods work/don't work with their setup.  I'd rather break this one than that one.  This is a private white listed server.  You really don't want access to this box.  You want to go play on game.minecrap.net

Please understand that IF you get access to this box, any builds are liable to disappear as the world is re-loaded from the production box from time to time.  In other words, don't make anything you want to have around for a while.</description>

      <name>Serenity Minecraft</name>
      <description>Our server is designed for experienced players that seek a place to build where they know their creations will be protected. We run a dedicated server in Chicago, IL. It has Dedicated box in Chicago, IL. It has 1x Xeon 3470 Processor, 12GB of ram, 100mbit connection, 64gb SSD, Runs on Ubuntu 64x, respectively. We also have a Google API 3d map that is updated every day as well as a dedicated Ventrilo server. Administration is online 24/7. 

Link to the livemap: http://server.serenitymc.net/map/ 

We do not run a whitelist. Instead, we offer all players to join our server as a guest, complete with /warp access, so one may explore the server to see if it&#8217;s right for them. If it is, we have clear instructions on how to gain Builder Access at spawn and also on our website, http://Serenitymc.net. We have adopted this application process to not only detour Griefers, but to filter out annoying children. 

These features combined create a great, lag free environment for the experienced player with no griefing. 

Fire will not spread, so you will have access to Flint and Steel if you want a fireplace. TNT is enabled. Creepers are enabled. Redstone drops 4 Glowstone dust when mined with a golden pickaxe, and leaves have a 5% chance it will drop an apple, 1.5% chance of a sapling, and 1% chance it will drop a Golden Apple. 

Give Serenity a shot! You won&#8217;t regret it.

      <description> What to expect when you enter the realm of mcAnarchy  

When you first enter MC anarchy you'll be greeted by a nice view of a fountain, which is located inside our legendary Oslo town. Inside the town you can purchase apartment spaces, previously owned homes or new plots entirely. A warning though, these places are generally quite expensive, so making a base outside the town is highly recommended.

      <description>A fun freebuild server hosted in Maine, USA. The spawn is a giant box of bedrock with no roof, and you may go outside the box to venture on your own if you like. We already have a few things built to help you get started. But make sure not to brake the rules or you will be jailed first warning, TempBan second, and PermaBan third. Pretty much the only rule is dont grief, and we have PVP on and its allowed in most areas.</description>

      <name>The Real SMP server 2000 Spots</name>
      <description>Have you ever wanted to play without admins who makes new rules just to make you do their bidding? Then you've come to the right place. We have easy rules for spawn and ALMOST no rules outside the spawn area. :D
The server is running 24/7 on a Mac Mini server edition, 2.66 GHz, 4 GB RAM.

I know the server probably can't handle 2000 users, but I set set it so that I can find the limit.

Hope to see you there!

PS: Canary is just here to do easy task for administration and to run Cuboid, we will also install the planes mod when it's updated for 1.4_01 SMP again. Also theres a chance we will enable other mods like this one :D

      <name>Windos's server</name>
      <description>A really active server with around 5 admins, with atleast one on usually. We have a twitter: twitter.com/WindosMinecraft which posts information about the server regularly. There are a lot of games like defend the castle and Capture the Flag which are played often. Minor griefing is allowed but Treasure Hunting is encouraged. It is a pvp server with the Heroic Death plugin. The town and other places like the arena are worldguarded but player built houses are able to get griefed. The admins love burning so if your house is burned down, dont complain because we know the feeling of lighting crap on fire. </description>

      <name>Brisbane Minecrafting!</name>
      <description>Running 24/7, Brisbane Minecrafting is said to be up there with the best servers in Australia with friendly admins and a large, active player base.

The server is currently running in a Faction Survival game-mode, which is unlike any other! Players have the option of joining a faction to be a part of a large protected area in which they can build anything they want, without the fear of being griefed! Faction leaders will often lead raids into other faction protections or other valuable areas to gain important materials or items from the opposing players. This experience cannot be overlooked!

"The faction setup is awesome! best one I have seen!" - Blackowt

We also have a variety of different ranks that players can obtain through their dedication to the server, their building prowess and their overall contribution to the server!

"Brisbane Minecrafting has been the center of my Minecraft experience for almost a year, it was one of the best decisions a player could have made to experience Minecraft as a whole." - Necromunger

I don't condone hacks and we have the necessary mods to help regulate that so don't waste you time. Server's fairly new so the players flow is a little smaller then normal but never an issue with lag. Give it a try.

Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of griefers out there, we recently reinstated a whitelist. Please leave a comment on the server's comments stating your minecraft name if you want to be whitelisted or Contact Traslogan/Paterso via Steam.

Spawnr,
And Much More!

      <description>Sobald die Stadt eine angemessene Gr&#246;&#223;e hat, habt Ihr die M&#246;glichkeit weiter zu ziehen und einen neuen Teil auf der Karte zu besiedeln. Dabei ist wichtig zu erw&#228;hnen das Ihr dies nicht alleine tun k&#246;nnt. Ihr k&#246;nnt nur mit einer Gruppe von mindestens 3 Spielern (F&#252;r den Anfang auf 2 Spieler beschr&#228;nkt) eine neue Siedlung gr&#252;nden. Also freundet euch schnell mit euren Mitspielern an und plant die gemeinsame Siedlung fr&#252;h genug.

Die erste Stadt die wir gemeinsam aufgebaut haben dient ab dem Zeitpunkt der ersten Aussiedlungen als Hauptstadt, in der sich alle Spieler frei aufhalten k&#246;nnen.

Die Spieler die erst auf den Server einsteigen nachdem bereits neue Siedlungen gegr&#252;ndet wurden haben folgende Optionen:

1. Ihr k&#246;nnt euch in der Hauptstadt niederlassen und geh&#246;rt keiner anderen Siedlung an.

2. Ihr schlie&#223;t euch einer anderen 'Fraktion' an.

3. Ihr sucht euch noch ein paar Mitstreiter und gr&#252;ndet eure eigene Siedlung.

Server Address: legitminecraft.com

Ventrilo Address: legitminecraft.com | Port: 3784

Website: http://legitminecraft.com 

Legit Minecraft is unique and community oriented. There are a multitude of Minecraft Servers; however, they lack the sense of community that Legit Minecraft has to offer.

Our community does not provide a simple server where you can simply build with people around you. We provide you with a friendly and dedicated community. The difference with us is we employ the unique Anti-Grief Test.

The Anti-Grief test is a way for us to prove you are willing to be a dedicated member to the community, and to ensure you are not a griever. 

There are plenty of free public servers to grief.

To truly solve grieving, we request a two dollar guarantee. The idea of this simple two dollar guarantee is that if your intent was to simply destroy others work, you would not be willing to pay. 

However, if you are looking for a SMP Server where you are free to play how you want and to be surrounded by a familiar, friendly community. 

For a full list of features and Mods, visit http://legitminecraft.com

      <description>Totally new world, survive on your own. Do not ask to be a OP, I will OP you if I feel you are trustworthy enough. I will be having it online almost 24/7 indefinitely if there is interest. Griefers and hackers will be banned. Do not destroy others creations.

When you create a chest you can lock it by punching it and unlocking it by punching it again. This way your stuff will be secure.

We are running three consecutive days and then one night.

      <description>Nice little server with a friendly community. Monsters and damage enabled, but don't grief on purpose or the admin and mods will smite you!

New users are allowed to build in a 2048x2048 area of the map, and after 2 weeks they gain access to the whole map.

      <description>IMPORTANT: Whitelisting Back On I've found a good group of testers!

Heyy everyone and welcome to the latest version of Gunya!  Now its being managed by previous co-admin RandomNameRandom and is running 37 plugins.  Note that at the moment the server is in a testing phase to iron out any bugs with plugins etc.  So the server will probably be laggy at times and some features will be bugged so keep that in mind.  The people that join now are TESTERS I can't stress that enough.  Therefore we wont really have the economy going or anything really but were trying our best for more information and to post on the forums visit gunyaserver.webs.com, yes it is free but I don't have the money right now to support a domain.  Thats all see you on the server.</description>

We consider this to be a strict survival server. Admins will not be giving out materials and we won't be changing the time of day. You will spawn in the middle of a snow-covered landscape and will need to quickly set up shelter to survive the night.

We use Bukkit and have various plugins installed, such as iConomy and MinecartMania. We will be adding Craftbook when a new build is released.

Server Rules

- Do not Grief. If you are found griefing, you will be banned.
- You are not allowed to build near the spawn.
- TNT is forbidden around the spawn area or other player&#8217;s houses or towns. You will be warned, then banned if you disregard the warning. Do not use more than four blocks of TNT at any one time.
- Placing Lava in or around players houses or towns is forbidden. You will be banned if found doing this.
- Ask players for permission before building next to their houses.
- Do not inventory hack. If found doing so, you will be banned.
- Do not fly mod. If found doing so, you will be banned.

Whitelist is currently turned off as the server is new and we would like players to visit the server and decide whether or not is right for them for the first couple of days before we turn it back on and start requesting applications to join.

Story: It was the year 2012 when it all began. The Earth's temperature began to rise at an abnormal level triggering volcano's and earthquakes throughout the world. 80% of the world's population was destroyed in 3 days and those who survived knew they were next. The greatest minds left from around the world gathered in a last ditch struggle to preserve human kind, they gathered all equipment they could and hijacked a space shuttle to take them away from the inhospitable enviroment. The ship took them to a nearby planet in the solar system that had recently been terraformed on expedition to the planet. The ship docked on the planet and the survivors unloaded.. realising this was only the beginning of their journey...

      <description>This server is all about having fun without to many restrictions.

That's why we don't have so many rules and not so many things are disabled.

Currently there is only one single thing that's disabled and that is creeper explosions(you can still obtain gunpowder), just because they keep SSsssSsSSss BOOM-ing in the spawn-area and that meens I (Hazzty, Admin) have to go there and repair the damages all the time wich I don't want to do,

I just want to keep the spawn good looking so all new people feel safe and welcome, wich they are till they walk out of the spawn-area where everything is allowed, PvP, using TnT, fire, starting wars so on and so forth.

But the server is not only about that kind of things, you are allowed to play the game in whatever way you wish.

And this is me signing of.
See you ingame!

      <description>24/7 SERVER!   We have a whitelist, please comment bellow if you would like to join!    ----------------------------------------------------------------
You are not required to give any money to join our server. All builds are legit, and we recommended that you come and join the fun!  ------------------------------------------------------

Please give us your Minecraft username, so we can get your joining process done as fast as possible.
    
  
  
GRIEVERS WILL BE BANNED, NO QUESTIONS ASKED.
    
Here's the catch guys. The server is running the unoffical bukkit update. We are looking to create a brand new map. Cities will be crated, so if you want to have any say in which city you want to be in, please signup for our website. 

CHECK YOUR SPAM MAIL, .co.cc websites get filtered into the spam folder

The current server will be saved as sort of an anarchy server, for when craftbukkit is down. You may build on the server at the moment if you like. Whitelist is OFF.

      <description> Welcome 
Loap=Life Of A Peasant
So basically you start out as a Peasant and work your way up to the top of Richness. You can choose to be what profession you want. Starting from peasant to Citizen or Solider to Mayor of your own city.
Their will be city wars. (Wars between city if the towns are enimies.

Support the thread if you likey. (tell yo friends)

STILL HELP NEEDED
What is a good server title name (I am not talking about replacing LoapCraft) I am talking about what the title should say to attract others to joining.
]What We Are Woking On Right Now./Have done
-Main Town still in progress and needs roads, sidewalks and decorations and a bit more Buildings.
-SkyCity is just starting. (could need help)
-SpawnRoom where it allows you to choose the town you want to start with and die for. Or you could loner it or make a rebel guild. 
-DockTown(or City idk) Just started somewhere in the middle of the ocean blue)
-Guilding is here. [Notch] 
-Most Plugins are fully functional.
-Skills are and leveling will make this server great and I will add uQuest again with custom quest installed.
-Little Fun Plugins that everyone will love.
-15 Player Max. Because of our 1G ram server. I will upgrade my computer from 4g to 8g rams hopefully if possible it will be a 3g or 4g and will hold 15 times more people.  [Notch] 
-Multiple ways to make money, Killing mobs, Selling things to shops(NPC or Chestshops), etc.
-TownWars (Which is not happening yet because we need more residents.) (15 people max for now)
-TDM OR CTF Wars- InProgress but it is installed correctly.
-Apartments in LoapTown and A Super Mall.

Towns:
-LoapTown (Free Build and apartments and houses pre-built(gonna cost but you can do dungeons, kill mobs and quests) Cash system: iConomy(virtual money)
-SkyCity (Non Free Build and has Pods aka Homes and jobs there. Communist. Cash System: Iron Ingot and Coal.
You can buy or rent pods. (Total Vanilla City No mod/plugin use there.)
-CraterCity (Under Construction) (Help Needed if you are a gud builder that can build in any kind of surface.)
-Atlantis (Under Construction) Has a cave in there with lots of treasures and Needs builders but you can breathe in that are as long as you have leaves around.
-TreeCity(I think or its called JungleTown) Not even close to being done but cool concept.

[sRanks/Groups
-Default aka NEWB - No commands and cannot build.(This is when we actually launch the real server which will have no whitelist for a while.)
-Citizens(also called a builder right now but it will change after real server launch)(After you fill out application you will be promoted to Citizen.) ( And can only protect 100 Blocks)
-Prisoner (Bad people go to jail and it is made of bedrock and unbreakable stuff until u have learned ur lesson.)
-Vip (practically has all the same commands as MOD/Admin but does not have the kick/ban etc commands) (and it cost 5 dollars) (Can protect all the blocks you want.)
-EXtremeVIP [Diamond] (All VIP commands and more goodies.)HAt command and other fun stuff
-Moderator (Kinda has VIP commands and Ban/kick etc commands too.
-Admin (has all comands sucker.)

IDEAS

Donate
]Vip: Donate 5 Dollars
Extreme Vip: Donate More than 10+
NO PAYPAL YET
VIP has=izones, other things (anything a builder has) And one unique name color. Unlimited Locked things and Reservations on the server meaning when the server is full they will kick out a default player for you to join)
Extreme VIP has=Every command, except admins(ban/kick ones) alot more. Name color and a BlockHead(any block on your head) look at the plugins list.

Rules
- Dont come in here to mess things up. (I do have map backups)
- No Grief (I do have Anti-Grief Plugins)
- Be Respectful
To Apply For JOB Use:
IGN (Gamer NAME):
Age:
What is your past experiece: (Being an ex-Server hoster would help me out alot)

Professions for Now:
-OPS (admin)
-Moderator 
-Builder (Available)
-NEWB (When you first join but this is for No Whitelist when the server is not underConstruction.
There will be more professions such as Soliders, Citizens, Mayor - and its assistants and more if you recommend anything good.

      <name>Oady's City Server</name>
      <description>Oady's City Server started out as a simple way to explore the world of Minecraft, and then went on to develop into a new generation of cities, the structure of some already built by our administrators and some yet to be created. Oady's City Server was first created by, as you may have guessed, Oady. In early 2011 the server began to increase in blocks and develop in style, and yet to this day has not been completed. The server so far has been built and expanded by Oady, The_Block_Master and Radishy2, as well as Radishhead and Radishy1 who have thrown in ideas here and there, but we are hoping that many others will contribute to the development of the server. Those who are at Oady's City Server would like to thank mainly Radishy2 and The_Block_Master for their building skills which are seen throughout the world. The server is likely to be made fully public in late April when the structure of the economy and much more has been sustained. You can join the server by visiting www.Oady'sCityServer.blogspot.com and messaging us with you account name and any questions you have. Let the building begin!</description>

      <description>***Temporary whitelist until 17th APRIL for maintainence***

Wincraft is a creative server, in which development of the centre city by builders is the main priority. After this city is finished, or near completion, we may be branching out to small towns on the outskirt of the city. We are relying on the help of the Minecraft community to bring forward thier most creative ideas, and help build up the city, step-by-step as everyone watches the city grow.
The aim of our city is to have functional buildings, and not just empty building which serve no use (Of course, exceptions are made sometimes). We may also incorporate some real-life structures into the city as well.

A server where you can build mostly wherever you want as long as you dont build over or destroy other players creations. You cannot spawn items though. You have to work for them.

      <name>Easy Going City (Hamachi Server)</name>
      <description>We're looking for more people to populate our new city. We use iron as our currency which you can acquire by completing city jobs and building projects. You can use iron to rent or buy an area to build your house. This server is focused more on building than survival (items will be spawned for you if admin is on). If there is a griefer simply notify the admin (jkubc) and he will investigate and ban if necessary. If you can't connect to the server its probably because you don't have hamachi, download the unmanaged version at https://secure.logmein.com/products/hamachi2/download.aspx. Once you download it, open it and press join a network, then enter k14654 as the name and polly1234 as the password.</description>

We have a multiworld freebuild system. There are multiple biome worlds that you can just have fun in and build what you want while fighting off all the same obstacles as in single player! We also have several donation incentives to increase your play speed, build more creatively, or even own your own unique world in our server!

Rules:
Don't use FlyMod, you will be warned only once.
Obviously, don't grief.
Don't beg for power.
Don't ask to be given items, you must collect them yourself!

We may shortly be implementing Towns and/or Region Claiming and Self Service.

      <name>Midnight Paradise Survival Server</name>
      <description>Midnight Paradise is a almost vanilla survival server. Plugins have been enabled in order to either&lt;br/&gt; prevent greifing or enhance the experience of the server. Please note that PVP and &lt;br/&gt;stealing are allowed. Server hours are 5:30 p.m EST - 12:30 a.m EST for weekdays and 24 &lt;br/&gt;hours for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Rules:&lt;br/&gt;
1. No Greiving - No destroying blocks that someone purposely put down.&lt;br/&gt;
2. No Rude or offensive language - A little swearing is fine but don't start yelling obscenities at other players.&lt;br/&gt;
3 Don't kill someone in their home - Think of the home as being a safe haven.&lt;br/&gt;
4. Respect the ops - They are a higher authority.&lt;br/&gt;
5. Don't ask to be an op - There is a process for this which will be explained in-game.&lt;br/&gt;
6. Remember the server is not your playground - Respect the server and dont randomly build/destroy stuff.&lt;br/&gt;
7. You have no rights, only privleges - Please do not abuse these privleges.
&lt;br/&gt;
Also hacking is not allowed but that is a given since hacking is not allowed in most if not all games. X-ray texture packs are also frowned upon.

      <description>This is one of the best dedicated Minecraft servers ever!  When you join you get a property in the city, the suburbs, or in the wilderness!  Whichever your desire.  On your first day at the server, feel free to ask the ops for supplies to build your house.  In this server we have restrictions on new players.  Everyone is allowed in but if you would like to build just ask an op or email winkchristian@gmail.com for that permission.  Mobs are on but don&#8217;t worry about creepers.  They do not explode on this server thankfully.  Everyone but griefers are very welcome and we greatly appreciate donations.  Thanks for visiting!  Enjoy and we can&#8217;t wait to see you!</description>

We do not allow the spawning of items and mobs here, we gather all our materials, that's what MInecraft was made for!  Due to recent griefing, for the next few days the server will have a White-list, so if you wish to check it out, please send me an email at bazero1337@hotmail.com

Why do you want to play on this almost new map ?

Tell me about yourself, just a few sentences is fine.

Recently switched from a creative server to an SMP server on a new map.
The only restriction is a build whitelist at the moment.
There is a lot of new land to populate...

      <description>Please read the beginners guide on our website before joining! It tells you everything you need to know about the server!


Timcraft is a legit, RPG styled survival server. Mods will not spawn items for players, and mobs and most types of damage are enabled. We have a dynamic economy(Prices change based on supply/demand), a realtime map, organized spawn town, with WorldGuard for protection, and even a working Nether world! And, of course, we have the standard stuff, like a dedicated, nearly lag-free, multicore server, with good pings, 100mbps synchronous line, and more then enough RAM to cover us, based on actual usage, not imaginary numbers. We even run the map in a RAM drive, which is over 8 times faster then a standard SSD!</description>

      <description>please use our domain mc.madgaming.eu to connect to the server and not the ip address.

for latest information check out our website www.madgaming.eu

The server is hosted in germaney and currently has a 40 slot cap. which we hope to increase more in the near future. At Madgaming we try not to have too many rules that prevent new players from using certain items or building in certains areas. so when you join the server for the first time you can straight away go into one of the portals to get out of the spawn area and choose a spot to build. you will have access to use all items except tnt. if you want the piece of mind that your creations will be protected then you can join a town.

Rules
griefing is not allowed and will result in a permanant ban.
stealing items is allowed
killing is allowed</description>

      <name>**********Republica! (Roma PVP Server) [Ranks] [PVP] [RP] [War]*************</name>
      <description>THE SERVER IS LIVE IP: 50.22.36.165:25624! 

We now have a forum!!! (http://romaserver.tk) It has all sorts of info on updates and community stuff.
Republica! is a server with an in depth ranking system based on the manipular legion of mid-republican ancient Rome (for the laymen, it basically means its really cool).  There are NPCs with Roman names and everything! If you are tired of grinding mobs and smp, vanilla servers, or repetitive PVP, this is for you!

Please Watch this tutorial! http://www.youtube.com/user/RomaServers#p/a/u/0/ZH1mq51Yyw4

The server is set in the city of Lucera in southern Italy at the start of the Bello Civilis (Civil Wars) between Gaius Julius Caesar and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus. Caesar has crossed the Rubicon into Italy and Pompey has just fled to Greece to gather his forces and has left Italy to Caesar. If RP isn't your thing, don't worry it won't be forced on you and as soon as you finish the tutorial you can put it behind you easily.

Ranking is based on xp gained from winning in the arena. Ranks give you access to permissions like /sneak and /warp, more health, and perks like flaming arrows that set your target on fire!

PVP reigns outside the neutral zones and arenas. There are no laws, just the chaos of civil war. Watch your back and always bring extra food, its gonna be a tough fight. Warps to "Outposts" will be set up when the land around Lucera is chewed to shreds to enable players to find materials, build, etc. on fresh land without having to walk for 10 minutes every time you die. AntiGrief has been disabled but there is a region around the neutral area that is build=false to prevent water and lava griefing that kept being a problem.

Forum:http://romaserver.tk It has lots of current info, social chatter and even codes you can redeem in game for money/exp.

For Beginners: The server has no whitelist, just enter in the IP and port to log on. There is a spawn jail with the rules, please read them or you might get banned without realizing why. There is a tutorial quest that uses NPCs to set up the back-story and then show you how to get started and how the battlegrounds work. It is STRONGLY recommended that you do this and I won't answer questions in game that are answered by the npcs or info areas. Talk to npcs by right clicking them with an empty hand, it can take a few tries to get all of what they have to say if they have multiple lines.

Plugins (going with the flow of the alphabet): BackupPlugin, [i]Citizens[/i], ControllerBlocks, CommandIconomy, Essentials, Groupmanager, HeroicDeath, iChat, iConomy, LastSeen, LocalShops, MultiInv [i]MultiVerse, [/i]NoCheat,[i] Parties[/i],[i] PartyDamageModification[/i] (made specifically for me :D thanks to PurelySatanic), properTime, RedeemCodes, Roles, Sendgift, Snowballz, Spyer, [i]SuperBow[/i], and WorldEdit and WorldGuard.

Coming Soon: Plugins are working 100% but due to some plugins in development, still to come is: Multiworld instances (stuff like gallic or egyptian towns with very difficult mobs and XP rewards), more gradual damage modifications with more increments, PVP classes (differing Health:Damage ratio) using subgroups, and rewards for PVP kills themselves.

Special Thanks: Talktofrank, TheHappyP1ll, Kyuyajustin (modding, building and beta testing); TEHNOOB3 and Viper23 (building); rangerfan2 (making the youtube channel and videos and beta testing); and Morgasm92, chronos17, FieryMailbox (beta testing).</description>

      <name>Imperialis</name>
      <description>Imperialis is a role-playing and survival server with one empire dispersed into eight major cities, and counting. This server is still in its BETA stages and is adopting a currency system, a building rights system, and a one or two server mods. A player upon joining will receive 1,000 coins to spend or save as he pleases. This is to give the player a start in the economy. Selling, trading, and buying items will be held by the players of the server. If one wanted to sell certain items, he or she would have to purchase a lot in the city, build a store, and sell those items. Trading can be done anywhere, as long as it is held within empire limits. Provinces that are not cities but towns, each have their own purpose, whether that be farming, mining, etc.. A government is in effect, with offices, a working treasury, and a presidency. The office of the presidency is an elected office. Each president serves a total of three to four Minecraft year (365 hours or 16 days - 487 hours or 21 days).

      <description>New survival server (monsters on), located in Australia, family friendly, legit server.  No PvP.

.

This is a heavily modded server and yes, that is a cocoa bean falling from your tree :)  Runecraft is enabled with limited runes.

. 

LAG: note - this server is located in Australia and you may experience lag if you're not in Australia - I can't fix this :)  

.

Please be patient, this is a very fresh server :)  I will attempt to keep it up 24/7 but make no guarantees - will see how it goes.

.

Rules

* Family rated language.  ***Foul language = BAN ***

* No X-Ray  *** XRAY = BAN ***

* No item spawn requests - legit server.

* No random constructions (eg. single towers to the sky) these may be removed without warning.

* This is a community based server - your building may be extended or "improved", regular players have some ability to protect areas.

* Keep within the theme of the server (somewhat realistic construction, often blending in with nature - eg. mountain homes, treehouses) eg. no skyline dominating pixel-art.

      <description>The Plague is a new, different, and exciting type of True Survival Minecraft server, centered around the undead characters of Minecraft - in abundance. Based off Medieval Zombie Siege (also by Owner Legolas75893), you must survive the night through the hordes. Zombies, Raiders, and Pig Zombies aren't the only bad guys you'll have to face - but is that your only problem? No, you must also defend yourself from catching an infection. The Plague is a 24/7 dedicated Minecraft SMP server aiming to recreate Left 4 Dead in the funnest, most dramatic and fun way possible. You will not survive.</description>

Our server is well protected against griefers (see mods section) and has a no tolerance policy when it comes to them.

We're not a big server and we are not open to everyone, although anyone can log in to view our server. Instead, we are looking for a small community of fellow crafters who want a community based server with a healthy and fun atmosphere. Submit screenshots of your builds and we'll upload them to the resources slideshow.

Want to register? Make sure you read our rules before registering. Log on to the server at least once. Then send us an email or chat message with your username and we'll add you asap!

      <description>Hello me and my friend made a server with the name Craftit, that we hope are fun for u to play on. We got 2 owners/admins and one moderator. We use bukkit and diffrent plugins we also will anable vip witch u will be able to buy or win trew diffrent contests. The plugins that are in use are iconomy u witch means u get money when u do diffrent quests and u can use the money to buy thigns in the shop. U get money for quest and u also get levels. And for the money u can buy things for example a lot, a house, repair ur things, and buy new things. Just talk to the admins/owners on the server to get a lot in the city, u can build anywhere out of spawn. Pvp is off and the server is roleplay. Btw we are looking for more people to join the staff. 

Best Regards Owners: kimmpa93 and bajsmedel

We don't have a lot of rules except we have a zero tolerance for use of TNT and flooding.
We Really wished you joined. Its a brand new server that is just made...
We do have a steam group as well. http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Mine4Idiots
If I find out that someone needs help I will help in what ever help needs to be done.
The Server resides in Virginia Beach, Virginia which is in America.
I have found for some reason that a lot Europeans are logging commonly.... I have no problem with it.
They tend to have a pretty good latency and complain only when there around big structures or more players are online.... I manage that part fairly well.
This is a server containing bukkit and is also running on Ubuntu.</description>

      <description>ArenaCraft includes 2 arenas. One being an operational spleef arena, and the other an 132x96 arena that is like the one used in the Hunger Games. There are very friendly Admins and OP's that will be on to help you. There are plots to be bought, and they are protected along with the arenas. This is more of an SMP server although you can claim the plots and will be able to ask for supplies from any of the OP's so that you can build your house. There are 20 Player slots and the Hunger Games arena will be open around some time after the Beta 1.5 update comes out. Please Register on the forum!

About:
Memory may be low, but Apachekiller have tested it with 8 people and and it runs very smoothly also I do wish the max player number was higher, but we don't have that much money so I am on a tight budget. If you guys want more slots and higher memory I highly recommend you donate to the server otherwise it will probably stay the same until I make more money. I know several of you guys have already donated to the original Minecraft server that Mr. Man was running and probably don't feel like donating again which is completely fine. I hope you guys find this server enjoyable and easy to use!
Rules:
1) Have Fun!
2) No Cheats
3) No TNT or fire
4) No Spamming
5) No 1x1 tower blocks that go up to last layer!
Donators:
Donators will get some special privelages such as being able to build in the Donators lounge and other goodies such as color name change!If you want to donate click on the donate button on homepage in the right sidebar!</description>

      <description>Hello! Have you ever wanted to play on a server that is creative and survival but that combo doesn't work out? I've found a way to make a server that seamlessly introduces creativity to survival! On our server users can get an infinite supply of simple items like stone, cobble, dirt, and wood; as well as free stone swords. To gain better equipment you either build for money or kill for money and then buy stuff at the shop. Killing monsters gains you "coins" which can be redeemed for items at a store inside our city walls.</description>

      <name>CGL-Craft</name>
      <description>CGL-Craft is based of the server T-Virus, which was a good server, but it seem it had some problems such as, huge lag spikes which were a common thing. That server had 1 admin to run it all or at least to my knowledge which left the players unhappy and unanswered. This server fixes all that, there will be no lag, there will be a admin on most of the time, We have admins eastern time, central and pacific time. Server restarts will be instant, if not the down time will last like 2-6 sec which will be if i need to stop and start the server but restarts seem to be instant. And lastly there will be no whitelist. If you need any further assistance pm me or get on ventrilo:derived.clants.net port:6664 or add me on skype zlavik928. And PS I offered help for that server the admin didn't respond or rejected it, so i decided to make this server, have fun! Plugins/Features: Mcmmo, Vampire, shop ,Pistons, Heroic death, Towny, iConomy, and Can support up to 3075 people on same time

      <description>Kilgrim is 100% PvP and most likely destroy server. This means the server will be a War-zone. You will be allowed to kill, steal and destroy other people creations.

But when you start you will spawn in the Green-Zone. This is where peace and quite walk freely and quietly...

Although we are 100% PvP, that doesn't mean we're not nice people! Just ask one of the higher ranks if you stuck or lost on something.

      <description>[NEW] This server is running Beta 1.4 until Bukkit has a 1.5 compatible build.


The Planet Pandemic Minecraft server!

We are a friendly server who will help out players on our server as much as possible. We have multiple plugins to make the game more fun and also will soon have Nether. We have to wait for Nether as we do not have a big enough map size to enable multiworld use. We have a Colosseum which we will host Survival Fridays on which we will record for our YouTube. Everyone can take part in this contest and the winner earns In-Game Money and a prize item.

We will host more contests and will post all of them onto YouTube. We hope you have fun on our server, if you need any more information ask the Admins: MyNameIsNeilHD, Sanity_x and Charlie_Creech.</description>

      <description>   This server is a server made by two friends. For just two people this is pretty amazing. In the first 20 minutes of posting this server on the website, 20 people joined and id say about 15 stayed. With their help, we have now built very good things and our server has flourished. All of our staff members are extremely helpful and the server is up 24/7 so you can play whenever you want! No need to follow someelse's schedule! The plugins we have are very easy to use and we will help you as much as we can.

      <description>Must Register to Build. Please see this forum thread for more information:
http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/3787/

Introduction
The Sensible Server is a private dedicated server with a dual focus. Multi-World support enables us to have the best of both worlds: Freebuild and Survival. Free-build World is a creative build world with advanced build tools and perks where you are free to design and build whatever you want. Survival world is just that, a cooperative or competitive experience much like the Single Player experience. Unlike the single player game, our survival world has many improvements and additions, like an economy, user created shops, competitions, and more.
Basically I'm seeking to create a full-featured MineCraft MMO-like experience.

Features:
* WHITELISTED SERVER, MUST REGISTER TO BUILD/USE COMMANDS.
* Guests can still look around to see if they want to join.
* MCBans to kick/ban griefers and prevent known griefers from even joining.
* Fully implemented permissions and build protection.
* Minecart Mania for advanced minecart creations.
* Customized /help menus in-game with only the commands you can use.
* Fully-featured economy with shops, trading, monster loot, contests, gambling, and more.
* Real-time world map website with chat and player positions.
* Greatly expanded functionality compared to vanilla servers.

Multiworld Details:
* Separate Survival, Nether and Free-Build worlds.
* World connected via central portal hub.
* Separate permissions, rules, and inventories for survival/nether and freebuild world.
* Survival World features:
o Enhanced Single player like experience
o Animal and Mobs are enabled, including giants, slimes, and wolves.
o Bounty hunting system. Put a hit on your enemies!
o Form groups with your friends. Allows for group chat, and prevents friendly fire.
o Advanced PvP system allows for fair play without griefing.
o Region protection to protect your build from others.
o Chest and door locking to protect your stuff
o Monsters drop cash and items for use in a functional economy
o Player-run shops!
o Purchasable "spells" from the in-game magic shop.
o Town areas where you can build a shop and your own house.
* FreeBuild World features:
o Item and Kit spawning
o Teleport, Warp, and Home functions
o MagicCarpet to fly around on
o WorldEdit and WorldGuard commands
o Region protection to protect your build
o TNT and Creeper damage blocked to prevent griefing.
o Control time with /time
o Many other features. Check /help in-game for complete list</description>

      <description>Owner: LiquidGalaxy
OP: StiffNippz

Started from day 1 on a handpicked seed although I have added some building from previous worlds I have played. This server is completely free build as long as you are respectful and responsible. Only join if you wish to contribute to a team effort and friendly environment.

Greifing or not listening to a warning issued by a OP is grounds for being kicked or more commonly banned. I'm just not going to put up with it.

I'm running craftbukkit 677 with many mods including mcmmo, Lockette, flatearth, SecretDoors, myWarp, blast control (above ground).

Check out http://plugins.bukkit.org/ and if you see anything interesting let me know and maybe I can try it out.

      <description>The Dedicated Brotherhood server is a 24/7 survival server.

We have it set up without whitelist but we do have a small application that you have to fill out on our forums to get build rights. While you are waiting for us to make you a member with build rights you may play around in our playground area (when you become a member you get to keep all the materials and things that you have gathered).

We have huge cities that are open to public and a very friendly set of admins and mods that are there to help you.
PVP is allowed on the server although we don't allow it inside of city walls.
We run bukkit and have the iConomy plugin so we have a currency and numerous shops.

Mobs are on although we have nerfed the creepers so that they don't damage buildings but do the full amount of damage to players.

Hope to see you join us soon
The Dedicated Brotherhood staff

You want to raid, infiltrate and assasinate, but then the whole clan is banned in a sec. Here, on the Clanwars server, you doesnt get banned! ( as long as you doesnt cheat )
I also uses a sneak mod, that gives you the command /SNEAK....   that makes your name unable to see through walls!

Come to this server, and play and make the stronges clan ever!

      <description>
About:

Bro V Bro is a hardcore PVP server. BroVBro server says, if you're on-line, defend your own base! Why let an imaginary forcefield stop your enemies from entering whilst you go pick flowers. There is no chest protection. Our unique protection suite only protects you while you are offline.
There is a strict kill on sight policy. Only noobs would leave their house without armour.

Features:

TNT!
Flint and Steel!
Lava!
Water!

Grief your enemies to your hearts content.

We even added grenades! Shoot an egg that gives half the power of a normal TNT!

Precious Stones: We use the precious stones plugin to great effect. 

We have two modes: 1. Online, 2. Offline.

When you are offline, you are fully protected. If your walls are are such that people can't enter your base, you'll do just fine.

When you are online, all blocks are protected from mining. But that doesn't mean you can't bust those walls down with some TNT or the grenades! The only block that can withstand TNT, obsidian - Mineable when online.

Diamond block - Block protection, 15x15x30 area.
Gold block - Offline explosion protection, 16x16x32 area (to cover Block protected when placed next to it)
Glowstone - Heals everyone 0.5 hearts per second
Jack-o-lantern of death - Deals enemies 0.5 hearts damage per second.

Chests can only be destroyed by the land owner but can be accessed by anyone at all times.

Enemies can use water, lava, flint n steel and place dirt in enemies land. Grenades can be launched to bust through those walls. True PVP at its best.

Few more things:

Parties: Join a party so you don't kill your bro's when raiding together. Toggle on/off Party chat.
Graveyard: We have spawn points every 500 blocks in each direction. When you respawn you will never be more than 250 blocks away from where you died. Instant replay!
2000x2000 Mapsize: Small enough that we don't need teleport. Not quite large enough that you can hide!
MCMMO: Standard RPG levelling plugin. Train your sword or repair or axe and a load more stuff. Everything enabled for higher damage and useful skills.
Growbie: Make bonemeal useful again.
Rules:

To put it short, there are no rules! How many times have you clicked on a PVP server and the first rule is no griefing or no stealing! wth?

If I had to name one rule: If you can do it, do it. We're not stupid, we've played PVP servers. Exploiting, cheating, you name it. If we're stupid enough to not have noticed a flaw - go for it.

Try to respect your Bro's. This is PVP, but thats not an excuse for racism or abuse etc.
But if a bro puts a hole in your wall, put a hole in his face!

No Whitelist:

Why would you? Why!

Come join in the fun:

50.22.36.168:25604


Planned additions:

Tweaked armour durability - Somethings not right here, we will make small changes, including gold armor to the mix to balance the pvp.
Gold tools - Gold tools will be used to mine nether materials, Gold weapons durability will be tweaked slightly.</description>

      <name>Freshcraft - creative server - 6 slots available Back Online!</name>
      <description>This is a server that has been running since the 1st of February. Normally this server is off during school hours GMT (6:00-16:00) and will probably turn off when I go (about 23:00).  Sometimes doesn't run if I am away though. This server is running the latest version of bukkit with essentials and other plugins. This means that all you griefers out there, there is no point in coming on the server as tnt doesn't work, lava doesn't spread and you can't break blocks, in certain areas. If you stay on the server and ask an admin to be able to test build you can prove to us that you can build good things.
Fly mods are permitted to admins and builders on this server, If the server is not running please feel free to contact me on skype: username: freshollie
Mods:

MineCity Roleplay

This community builds city's with natural resources. if we find out an admin abuses his rights on building the city he will be banned and the city restored so we stay 100% hack clean

Do we use commands?

The answer is yes. we use commands for server administration and for the fun of other players. like war area's. This server Got a new plugin too! Vampires! makes the night more dangerous. look out for burning creatures during the day!

      <description>Greetings! Welcome to a kind of new, one month old, RP styled Freebuild. What is a RP/Freebuild? You can do whatever the fuck you want (within reason, and rules). We are relaxed enough to spawn items... based on seniority on sever (more time played, more I trust you enough to spawn things). There is no whitelist!
[/size][/align]

Our community is not to big, but not to small. You can always expect at least 10 other dedicated Minecrafters to accompany you, and perhaps give you lodging. 

Staff is based on building skills, and social skills. All of our staff is either halfway decent builders, skilled organizers, or just nice, chill people. Please note, inquiring about being staff in anyway will result in a very low % chance of getting staff. 


If you have disputes with other members, then we expect you to settle it yourself. Griefing must be proven with either a screenshot or a video. Stealing from chests would be your own fault, since we have active chest protection.


PVP has been disabled, except for in certain places and arenas.


You may apply for a plot of land once you have been established. That means you must have built on this plot and developed it enough for it be protected.

      <description>Decent server, uptime is not 100%, I'm considering getting a host. If I get a host it would probably be 10 players max so 6-8 spots left. The uptime is form 3-9 on weekdays EST and from 8-10 on weekends. Currently there are 4 members, but regularly 2. I am running bukkit with about 7 plugins. Need excellent builders. People that make huge things and 8-bit stuff like that. NO GRIEFING. Btw monsters are on. When you first join you won't be able to build, so ask JSmoove98 for build rights.

      <description>Hallo an alle!
Mein Minecraft Server "Platoniccraft" ist vor kurzem Online gegangen!
Jetzt fehlen nurnoch die flei&#223;igen Spieler 

Der Server bietet zurzeit 8 Pl&#228;tze wird aber eventuell noch aufger&#252;&#223;tet.

Ihr d&#252;rft sofort mit dem bauen und dem minen anfangen!
Der Server verf&#252;gt nat&#252;rlich &#252;ber verschiedende plugins und es werden noch weitere folgen.

Im Moment bin ich noch offen f&#252;r alles, habe aber vor einen Survival Server draus zu machen.
Abgesehen von Spielern werden derzeit auch noch Mods und Admins gesucht.

Vorbeischauen kostet nichts und ich freue mich &#252;ber jeden Besucher! 

Wer also Lust und Laune hat der schau einfach mal hier vorbei:
IP: 78.143.12.183:25565
oder: platoniccraft.minecraft.to

      <description>Hosted on my Mac Mini Server. No griefing, but you can build anywhere you want as long as it's reasonable. No land hogging, no being a jerk. I am not one of those annoying people who lock everything. This is a simple server, make your town on it!

RULES:
No griefing
No hogging land (although you can build anywhere)
No mutes (you must respond if an OP talks to you)
No being a jerk in general

But, unlike other servers, I encourage building wherever you want as long as it's OK with others...</description>

      <description>Always running latest Bukkit and Minecraft
There is No initial whitelist. All players are welcome.
This is a build and pvp server. Staff will work with users who want a little help getting a nice structure built. But also understand that sometimes people will find you and want your shit. and they might just kill you for it. We have a couple of shops up right now. 

Spawn is not crazy, just a platform in the forest and you can get going to your building. The shops are right underneath spawn so feel free to stop by. We are making most initial tools very cheap so new users can get a good start.

Lastly, the rules are light but stern. There will be NO FlyMod, Duping, or X-Ray.
Any Users found to be doing any of this will be immediately banned without warning or question.
We have no hack and antiXray to detect dupes, movement errors and xrayers.
You will be found, just dont use them here.</description>

      <description>It's a 10 slot v.1.4_1 server that has a working economy, shops and commands.
We have made a few buildings in the map, but its mostly brand new / unexplored.

It is a survival server with pvp, but with protected properties and places where pvp can NOT be done.
There is no whitelist, so anyone who wants to can join, though we prefer scandinavians / europeans because of server location.
The server is up 99.99% of the time 24/7.

The ip is:

nl1a.mcbox.net:26001

We welcome any spirited builders, survivalists and pvp'ers! </description>

      <name>Global International Settlement Program</name>
      <description>Hello there lowly employee! You may be wondering why you were forcibly removed from your warm, cozy, cube before blacking out, only to wake up on a beach in the middle of nowhere with nothing but the clothes you were wearing. Well, most of them. Some of the higher ups very much like socks. Well, you remember the pig incident? Well, those shenanigans caused plenty of damage that must be paid for. The total comes to&#8230; two miiiilion dollars! Yes! Two of big mommas were pulled out of the pockets of our poor, poor company&#8217;s coffers. Due to this infraction, all of those involved (your entire division) have been transferred to the Global International Settlement Program.
Global International has recently acquired a large amount of land we were told was uninhabitable. The Global International Settlement Program was set up to test that hypothesis. Your job as a member of the program is to procure resources for Global International Food Distribution. At the moment there is a high demand for cobblestone, dirt, and gravel. Your local sales representative, Dwiggit, will receive your donations. Why Dwiggit, you ask? He is the only member of your division who has loyally served this company without a single issue, unlike the rest of you little f*ckers&#8212;err, employees. You will be compensated for your efforts in the form of approved Global International Dollars, or &#8220;Gid&#8221; for short. Your compensation will depend on which resource you donate. 1 gid for a cubic meter of cobblestone, 1 gid for 2 units of dirt, and 3 gid for each 2 units of gravel.
So, stop reading this memo and get back to work. We expect great things from this program, don&#8217;t disappoint us.

      <name>Duke's Brickmania Server</name>
      <description>A server dedicated to a small community. Will enable certain mods that enhance gameplay in future when stability is clear and development comes to somewhat of an end. This is a fairly new server which was created in response to a suggestion in a forum concerning a Minecraft Clan. 

This is also dedicated to Brick Mania, a forum which serves mainly the purpose of discussing the sandbox game Blockland but in addition has numerous other threads and topics. Visit there if you're interested in joining, since the white-list is activated at the moment for obvious reasons (grief-prevention, keeping it exclusive to Brick Mania members, etc.). The link is listed in the Forum Thread area, please post in the 'Game Talk' section, in the 'Brick Mania Minecraft Clan' topic posted by Megabear, and do as instructed by him to create your application. Once processed you will quite possibly be able to join, although you may need to find your spot in the community beforehand.

*Certain persons may be able to join without applying at Brick Mania, whom will only be allowed to officially join by me.

*This is again somewhat of a new server, there are still quite a few things for me to edit and do. I still have to impliment some mods most of which will probably be recommended by the community, promote some mods to keep watch over members, etc.

      <description>Mordcraft is our new SMP server which runs a minimal number of plugins to ensure not only are your chests and buildings protected, but that you can enjoy a lag free, friendly server experience.

We have only a few rules, don&#180;t grief, don&#180;t be abusive, and always build at least 50ish blocks away from other peoples buildings.

Our server also has The Nether enabled, so feel free to go in search of Gold Dust and other materials. We also use iConomy, Towny, LWC for chest protection, and a few others. We only use necessary plugins to ensure the server is not overloaded or laggy.

Whitelist applications are accepted daily.  Just sign up and post in the Click Here to Apply! section of the  forum at www.mordcraft.com.</description>

Same goes with diamond and gold. Find over 30 in one spot! Live in towns, or even make your own town. See bunches of fascinating new stuff, such as the showers, kunlun, mystix's shop, and Ginkey's house!   Join Mxsrv today! Just post your application for the whitelist here, http://www.mxsrv.net/viewforum.php?id=14. Monsters are on, PvP is on, Animals are on, and much more!

      <name>[UK][OSIRIS][Craftbook,MCMMO,Stargate,LWC,iConomy,Shops]</name>
      <description>UK based server, hosted in a Manchester data centre.

Guests can build in the guest world of the server.  Use the portal on the "world" network to get there.    Please check out the forum if you wish to register for build rights in normal world.  We are hoping to screenshot and learn how to make a in-game video to show off some of the builds.


The idea of the server is to have a real SMP server with a building element,  along with a minor RPG feel of money, trade and some small perks to playing a lot.  We was running a Dynmap but its offline for now until we upgrade again as its a resource hog.

You can visit the forums at http://osirisminecraft.freeforums.org/ and we would like to take some new builders on.  

The rules are very common sense.
No abusing other players, respect others builds and surrounding area. no item begging or crying about lag, when 99% of the time its client side issues.

      <description>This is an RPG (Role Playing Game) Server, There are several jobs you can have: Police, Miner, Builder, Hunter.. And more too come as the server progresses! The server owner is me, "illusion8898" Or on any other game its "Zongplop", And Iam the mayor of the town, I'll pay you too do these jobs, There is a market, building slots etc.. But heres the twist, you can either live in civilization or go out and live out in the forest... And the Idea is, Civilization vs Rebels, Rebels are allowed to kill you if your out of the city and they are also allowed to attack the city, But say if police see them with a weapon out, They can teleport you too Jail. Only Admins can be police as I dont want everybody to have the ability to teleport.

You search for a nice place to play and slaughther zombies?
Then you just found that place.
We're running on mighty dedicated hardware to ensure you the most fun possible ;)
Also, we have a few mods enabled to help you protect your stuff against idiots

However, there is no plugin that would break the original Minecraft Survival feeling!
We have a couple of friendly administrators and you can sure have fun with the staff.
But - be an ass, insult the staff(or in fact, anyone else), break any rules, stop using your brains,
and you will see the ban hammer swing upon your head and there is no coming back.

Last but not least:
It is advisable for you to sign up on our forums to stay up-to-date 
with recent server activities and to apply to get buildrights.

You must apply at the website forum thread for build rights, or an alternative to that would be to get 50 points in 1 night and win in Monsterhunt. Monsterhunt takes place every evening in-game. You will get gear and head out with your squad to take down as many of the assaulting mobs as possible.

      <description>En relativt liten svensk server som har en k&#228;rna med trogna spelare som vart med &#228;nda sedan servern startade p&#229; min egna dator i februari. N&#228;r vi sedan tog steget ut och hyrde oss plats hos Multiplay och servern blev 24/7 s&#229; &#246;kade antalet spelare lavinartat. 

Vi har nu runt 30 spelare som har vart inne och spelat minst en g&#229;ng och det &#228;r runt 15 stycken olika spelare som lirar varje dag. 

Verkar de intressant s&#229; joina oss! Alla p&#229; servern &#228;r otroligt trevliga och admins hj&#228;lper er att svara p&#229; s&#229; m&#229;nga fr&#229;gor som m&#246;jligt!

De regler man b&#246;r k&#228;nna till &#228;r att man inte ska griefa, stj&#228;la, vara otrevlig mot andra spelare i chatten. Vill man diskutera och vara otrevlig kan man g&#246;ra det i pm p&#229; v&#229;rt forum eller genom att anv&#228;nda /tell kommandot. 

&#196;ven hacks av olika slag (t.ex Fly hack, X-ray hack etc) &#228;r totalt f&#246;rbjuda och den som anv&#228;nder det kommer bli bannad.

Bes&#246;k &#228;ven och bli medlem p&#229; v&#229;rt forum d&#228;r hittar du mer utf&#246;rlig information om servern och andra viktiga saker som kan vara bra att veta :)

      <description>.:LATEST NEWS:. We've upgraded our VPS to 4GB RAM and 4-Cores! Due to the tremendous amount of traffic we've been getting, we've expanded our slots to 40!
Introduction. Okay. So obviously, your on this page looking for a great, unique, and friendly server, that is free to play. Of course, you want it to be 24/7, Stable, and you want it to have Anti-Grief Mods. Tainted-Realm understands what your looking for. The map is amazing, the community is friendly, the staff is organized, and we are updating daily. Thanks to our amazing team, we have succesfully put up a respectable server in about 1 month. Read on for more information.
Stability.
Our source is as stable as can be, and so is our VPS. We have an Amazing Quad-Core 4GB RAM VPS. It's like a car gaining speed, with powerful torque to keep itself going. We don't think about "Spending the least amount of Money". We want a respectable server, which generates enough profits to keep itself online for years.
Community.
Our community is very friendly, and is becoming more populated daily. 99% of our players don't quit. Tainted-Realm isn't just for enjoyment, it's a necessity. It truly is beautiful, inside out. We guarantee you'll be satisfied.
Staff.
Our Staff team is mature, and amazing. We only pick those who we know can do it. We don't randomly choose players, such as those servers that choose "The first player". We chose some player's who helped Beta test Tainted-Realm, and know the game well.
Donations.
Obviously, everything has to have some sort of income to stay online. We have created two ways, so we just about cannot go offline due to insufficient funds. We give our players the option to donate. Currently, we produce enough to pay for the VPS + Webhosting with only a bit of Pocket Money, but that could change at anytime if we don't keep our community satisfied, so there is some more motivation that will get us excited about updating. We value our players, and their donations. Our donation's are strictly ONLY used for Tainted-Realm.
Support.
Don't you just hate it, when your on a server, waiting for a Staff Member to help you? We do too. Just for this reason, we made sure to have enough staff in every timezone to help you with any problems!
Why should I join?
Of course, the famous question is included. WHY should I join? You should join Tainted-Realm to become part of a community which is more populated, and updated daily. We listen to our Player's suggestions, not just ask them to "sound" like we use them. We love to hear our player's opinions. I gurantee you that almost all of our Players will still be playing in 5 months for today.
Conclusion.
By now, your most likely thinking about joining. Make the right decision, and join today. You won't regret it. Our server is nearly a RSPS gamer's dream. The layout is amazing, and is the community, skills, and many more things. Join us on our quest to be the top, and longest lasting server in RSPS history.

      <name>RPG Multiplayer</name>
      <description>A great RPG server for anyone who wants minecraft to be more interesting, Includes custom made quests, RPG skills mod (mcMMO), iConomy, herochat, worldguard (so you dont have to worry about your stuff getting griefed or stolen) and plenty of other mods. I have 2 years of experiance with MC servers so I've picked out the best mods in my opinion to use.
Before you join:
-11am to 11pm pacific time, you never lose your work or stuff though, always saved
-If you log on and an admin isnt online (mbrandt21), you wont be able to do anything as I must move you from the default class to a class where you can actually build and I set you up with a plot etc.
-Check out the server map (The main city is huge)
http://www.minecraftworldmap.com/users/mbrandt21
-Im very cool, so dont worry about abiding by the rules 100%, just dont burn down any houses:(

      <name>Suicide Gamers Freebuild Server</name>
      <description>Our humble little server is looking for more players, we are a very small community. To avoid Greifing guests cannot build, but feel free to look arround and if you like it go request membership here http://suicidegamers.realmsn.com/t1900-membership-application
 
Generally, we are a mature community - spamming chat with things like "failtroll" "umadbro" "trololo" etc... will get you muted, kicked or banned. Not everyone will fit in here, if you constantly annoy , criticize, or harass other players - you will be taken off the white-list and blacklisted. Admins can refuse access to the server to anyone, for any reason at anytime
 
We have a exact replica of mistral city with NPC's for some rollplay fun!
 
One last note, we will google your username and look to see if you are on a greifling list!

      <description>This server is usually up 24-7. I fit isn't, wait a few hours and try again. Everyone must listen to RellikKiller (A.K.A. [God]Rellik), and dethmij while on server. Also, ONLY RELLIK CAN USE LAPI.
If you create something that looks worthy of protection, then I will place Zoning protection on it eventually. Everyone can build, but make sure that you don't build to close to anything else. give commands are avalible for those who want them, the command is /i (item number) (item quantity).

      <name>The Carbon Core Minecraft Server (Version 1.5_01) (Bukkit 726)</name>
      <description>Welcome to "The Carbon Core". Many of our players have broken off from United Divided due to mass griefing as of late, and thus have taken extensive steps to prevent griefing. Our server is NOT white-listed, however you must at least seem trust worthy enough to gain "Trusted" status to be able to build.Several players have already been thwarted via this tactic, so we will continue to employ it.


MCbans is installed and will be used if any "Trusted" players decide to go rampant and break the rules. Looting is permitted, but as a counter to that we have chest lock (/lwc). 
Basic commands to protect chests:
/cprivate or /lwc -c private   . to add players to your chest use /lwc m &lt;playername&gt;
/sethome sets your home to teleport back to anytime you enter /home it can be changed infinitely
but you can only have 1 at a time. Use /msg &lt;name&gt; to privately talk to said player. /help for the rest of the commands (many are dev based)


The Nether is fully up and functional! grab some obsidian and flint and steel and build yourself a portal! 1:8 travel is also preserved.


Griefing, X-Ray, Fly hacking is NOT tolerated and will result in an immediate ban.


Curses are allowed, quite frankly no one gives a shit.


More mods to be installed soon.</description>

The server is RP and PVP but we discourage griefing. Anyone who asks can have their home or mine protected so only they can create and build. All chests are lockable. 

We are inviting other gamers who like to play together for fun. Our admins are the most professional. No playing favorites, no admin item spawning, no using admin power to force other players to do anything. We only use the admin powers to stop bad griefers, protect homes, and solve problems....  never to spawn items (not even for ourselves). We are very responsive.

If you are nice and like to group play (including a little fun PVP action) you should like this server.

The entry room allows you to start in whatever bio-area you want. No more being forced to start in the same place as everyone else.  We even build dungeons with daily respawning treasure chests for those that wish to fight for their goods instead of mining and farming. 

Commands include: /sethome /home /compass /cc and of course portal use</description>

There are few rules, and this is them:

No unrealistic buildings
-Tall Towers
-Floating Buildings
-Brick - Its ugly, and unrealistic :D
-Things that genially could't happen in the real world
No greifing - Obviously
Do what the admins says
No stealing
No TNT
No lava -Unless authorized my admin
Have FUN! &lt;-- Cheesy ending!

      <name>&#9668;| ARADIAH |&#9658; - Fantasy Building &amp; More! [NO WHITELIST]</name>
      <description>Ever had trouble finding the server just for you? Are other servers just too big for you to have fun? Do you just want build? Then Aradiah awaits you!

Now you may be asking, "Why should I choose this server over another server in the Survival Servers section?", well the answer is this, we try to listen to our members on our server rather than just ignore them. Through general observation, most servers in this section are huge with huge whitelists and complicated whitelist applications.

We are trying to change this abomination called the whitelist application.

Our server may be small, but we have a close nit group of people who are really nice and will help you out if you need anything at all. Aside from our normal fantasy world, we also have a classic-esque world where you can build almost whatever you want where the sky's the limit!

Though we don't have a whitelist, you still have to wait till an admin is online so they can change your group to builder. Now you may consider this a to be whitelist but this is different, whitelists usually kick you from the server when you try to log in, making you miss out on what could be. You never really have anything to look at besides a couple of screenshots... </description>

      <name>Monkey Nicaud Minecraft</name>
      <description>(The uptime is NOT 0%. I have no idea why it says that!) Monkey Nicaud Minecraft is a newly created community. We aim to be a build / survival server with a barter type economy. We have active, fun OPs and are looking for more that can help us with Bukkit, the reason being is because we are new to hosting Minecraft servers and want to make it as enjoyable as possible. We currently run on LogMeIn Hamachi with Bukkit / CraftBukkit and have the general essentials. We plan to add either World Edit/Cuboid, LWC, and Towny. If you're interested in applying to be an OP to help out with bukkit plugins then please e-mail us at MonkeyNicaudMinecraft@gmail.com and we will discuss it further. Please note that the server is not public yet and is on a whitelist until we are ready for release. Thank you.</description>

      <description>GeekSwede doesn't have a whitelist. Everyone is allowed to join in directly.

GeekSwede has a small, expanding town with protected yards. You can buy your own yard for in game currency (Using iConomy). Despite this, you're free to build and mine outside the town without yards and such.

Groups are marked with a colored text in front of their name. (For instance: Admin[Normal]Norrox)

Admins, Mods and helpers are the only groups permitted to sell you anything. If someone else tries to, report them.


Worth knowing:

   1. Earn money through QUESTS. Type in "/q give" to get a quest.
   2. You can also earn money by buying and selling stuff. More on this later!
   3. Monsters are enabled. Beware.
   4. Killing other players is not restricted at all outside of the town. Play carefully, kill pigs, stock up on food.
   5. We use LWC to protect our chests. Write /lwc in the chat for the commands and general help using it.
   6. The server is a work in progress, and is still being set up. Your building help is appriciated!
   7. The server owner's IGN is Norrox.
   8. Allthough yards are protected, you're welcome to mine anything outside the town. What is the town and what isn't should be quite obvious.
   9. Play nicely. Even though killing people is allowed outside the town, it's not nessecarly encouraged to randomly kill a new player.
  10. We're going to create 'town guards'. They're not to be messed with! Hopefully!
  11. I made this topic with permission from the server owner. I am not the server owner.


The server is hosted on a 100mbs up, 10mbs down line. It's located in sweden.

Default players can only build in an area called 'Slime Town' which is limited. They can be promoted to Trusted players who can build anywhere by building something nice inside Slime Town. VIPs are donators who get cool features like: WorldEdit, item spawning, flying and more...

Many players have said this server is their favorite, why don't you come and find out for yourself?</description>

      <description>This server is a work in progress, we have basic plugins to protect both admin buildings and user, chest/house protection and we also have portals that (sometimes buggy) take you to other precessions we are building at. This server does NOT tolerate griefers, if you are caught griefing you will get a kick and a warning, if you carry on it will escalate to a perm ban. You can't spawn blocks, there are almost always admins on (GMT / England time) and are looking for builders to help out!

You can get more commands such as MC, God mode and spawning items if you donate (info on website &amp; from admins. We hope you join and have fun!

We also have English talking Teamspeak 3 the IP is 109.108.140.14 and the port 9987, feel free to drop in for a chat!</description>

World 8-4 has been totally redone! The main world is a SMP / RPG world
- Shops
- McMMO leveling system
- Iconomy
- EcoCreatures! - Animals / Mobs drop coins!
- Monster Hunt!
- Stargate system that connects 3 different worlds together (SMP/RPG, Free build and Nether)
- Separate world Inventories to prevent cheating in the main SMP / RPG world
- Lockable Chests, Doors Etc...

World 8-4 has a nice balance of features without having 1000000000000000 plug-ins to deal with

We also have a free build world with /i commands for everyone. I use separate world inventories so people can't cheat :p There is also The Nether World for you to explore! These are all connected via Star gates! fun stuff :p

      <name>BedrockMiners RolePlay Server </name>
      <description>BedrockMiners is a minecraft community consisting of 2 servers, but we are thinking of adding a third.
We consist of a RolePlay Server, a Survival Server and a soon-to-be Creative Server.

RolePlay Server :
Our RolePlay Server is a server run on Bukkit that uses a variety of plugins to create a RPG world but we are also very interested in building at the same time because you can level stats such as mining and excavating. 
We are trying to get a large community that constantly play the game so that the server can be as full as possible. There is currently no white-list, we went for this decision because it should bring more players into the community.

Some of our main plugins are :
 - TownyMod
 - mcMMO 
 - SuperHeat
And many, many more. For a full list of plugins visit our site by clicking the (www) button you can see above.</description>

      <description>A survival server with a few mods and economy that are used in a way to create a more real life community, with access to the nether and also having a creative world with absolutely all access to any and all mods put in place on the server, but this world is white listed so join soon and start earning some trust. The Mods are very very friendly and kind and tehy try to help everyone they can while the admin is pretty laid back and lets people do what they want and helps them when possible. All 4 mods are people that joined the admin at some point through minecraft and became friends and there is always room for more.

http://72.9.159.195:8080/Public is a website about it.</description>

Why play a server in fright of being griefed? Don't have to when you play on the Big Dig, because if you do get griefed it will be rolled back in the click of a button!

We've got an awesome community, a website and a Voice Communication server named Ventrilo in which we use to talk to people.

Ventrilo: IP : 174.34.191.60 Port: 3900   (There's instructions on how to use ventrilo on the forums)

      <name>Pandoracraft [faction-pvp] [Bukkit] [Vampires]</name>
      <description>PandoraSurvival is a Softcore-pvp server dedicated to the system of factions. There are currently Two factions:
-Obsidian
-Glowstone

These factions both have their own 'starting city' they can use in the very beginning as a base, or as a meeting point/to trade with people. 

The two factions should treat eachother as Hostile, and should try to kill eachother on sight.

Another great aspect about the game is vampires, vampires have a lot of pro's, in addition to two MAJOR cons.

-Vampire won't be attacked by mobs unless they attack first.
-Vampires have no fall damage
-Vampires can 'fly'
-Vampires heal over time and do more damage

To all of these awesome things, there are a few setbacks.
-Vampires burn in the sun, which forces them under the ground/inside for the 'daylight'
-Vampires take 2x as many damage with wooden swords
-Vampires need Blood, blood makes you auto heal and jump high. but if it drops below 50 ( 50/100 ) you start getting damage instead of healing.

To become a vampire you need to go to the 'dark altar' which is the gold block in the tunnel near the spawn. you need 1 Mushroom stew, 10 bones, 10 sulphur and 10 redstone to become infected. and it will take 3 'in-game' days to go from infected to vampire.

To cure vampirism you can click the good altar (everyone can make one, but there are two in the main cities) which are the lapiz-blocks near the gate of the main city. they are free-to click.

The server currently supports 20 slots, but will eventually expand to at most 25/30.
Note: If you join you'll be a 'peasant' (after i gave you building rights) and you will be able to build, but you'll be 'kill on sight' for all factions, to join a faction (either before or after logging in for the first time) you can post here in this format:
Name:
Faction to join: (obsidian/glowstone)
This HAS to happen, otherwise the forum wouldn't get bumping at all, and this post needs to stand fairly high :P)
PS: The least active faction right now is: either please join this faction for a competitive and fun to play server.

      <description>Obviously Minecraft is a build with what you get server, you mine, you craft and what you get from doing such is all you have. No freebies (unless from competitions etc) 


The server will be based in starting at a "spawn town" and from there North, South, East and West will have paths leading each to one of the 4 starting moderator cities, these 5 locations will be the only things protected, you may join and build at any of the cities or you may venture alone and start your own wee house with just you and/or with a friend, there are no limits as to where you can build unless the area is part of a city and you may build whatever you want.

Basically this is a survival server as health and monsters are all turned on, nether is enabled and access is granted via portals. You must eat to stay alive, you must kill or run from monsters and you must light up your area to avoid nasties.

Obviously Minecraft has plugins such as worldedit worldguard and lockette, if you are new to our server you may request for your chests to be locked from an administrator or moderator, if you wish to build in a city you may ask one of the administrators or moderators to allow you to the protection which will enable building in that area or you may build on your own with friends or even start your own city!
We are hosted on a stable VPS so the server is up 24/7 unless there are any unforseen troubles or problems which may popup but in that event we will be back up soon! so come join us now!</description>

      <description>Shadow Games presents the Shadow Games Minecraft Server.

We have over 13 mods, with the number increasing every day to make your game experience as good as possible.

Mods:

Anti-Grief AutoAnnouncer DeathSign Essentials Group Manager iWatch LightVote NoExplode SignOwner StopFireSpread WorldEdit WorldGuard and a few others.


What you can do:

We have many different areas for people to do different things on. We have areas where you can just free build and make some nice stuff. Other areas where you can make your home. We spent a long time making a template for you to make your house around, but it would also be awesome if you went out exploring the world. If you were to find a nice area, contact an admin (an admin normally has a red name) and ask him to make the area a warp zone, and best of all you can name the area!

We also have a Wall of Fame, so if you make something epic, your name will go on the wall and you'll get builder status and the picture of your creation will go on our gallery page. With builder status it's easier to make the stuff you want with your friends :D


Staff: 

Hennersthemon - Server Owner 
Khedgey - Server Owner and ICT Specialist 
Hxchikken - Co-Owner who sometimes joins 
Jespus - Super Moderator who likes to be with Henners 
GTASanvince - Super Moderator who likes to be away from the crowd and make some nice houses 
Aidan98 - Moderator/Co-Owner so don't get too near him because he's Scottish


What we expect from you!

Don't try to grief. You'll fail and get yourself banned :L Follow the simple rules! Most of them are common sense, and mainly aimed at griefers The reason we don't have a whitelist is because we believe our Anti-Grief tools will stop all the noobs :D
Don't be afraid to ask for something! Building a giant statue? An admin will happily supply you with the materials you need (and if you wouldn't mind, give the Admin the hex number of the material (Lava, TNT, Water, Bucket of Water, Bucket of Lava, Fire etc. won't be able to be sent to you! :D).


Support!

If your finding the server is being minged, take a screen shot of him in action, get his name clearly in the photo and we;ll get the griefer banned.</description>

      <name>Cion Minecraft Server[100 Mbit Connection]</name>
      <description>Welcome To The Cion Minecraft Server.

Cion is a Freebuild &amp; Survival Server with alot of plugins, One of the plugins we are running is dynmap that you can see on our homepage.

Right now we are trying to make the server as lag free as possible, and what we heard from our members,is that we are doing a fine job.

NO WHITELIST:  as we wait for our server to get updated, we have removed the whitelist and created a new temp-world. so everyone is welcome, anyhing goes!

When the server has been updated the whitelist will once again be added, so if you like this server, you can registar at http://cion.sytes.net/.

Before the latest update:
________________________________________________________________________

Cion have added a whitelist, to keep unwanted players out, so if you want to play on the cion server, then you have to register at our homepage : http://cion.sytes.net/.

You can find more info about the server at http://cion.sytes.net/.</description>

      <description>This is a dedicated 24/7 server.  Great connection especially for those in the USA, but our users in Australia and UK have reported blazing fast speeds and no lag too.  

There is a protected city, with lots starting at 12000 coin to start your own chest shop.  This is an iConomy based money system.  There is a server shop with nearly every item on it, but player shops are cheaper.

Outside of the city anything goes, there are factions enabled here, join one today and go to war!  You even get money for PvPing.

Monsters drop loot!  Come check us out today and see what its all about.  We have a dynamic map, just type the server IP into your web browser with socket 8764.</description>

      <name>BOOMtown - Griefing Server - No Whitelist - Lots of Mods</name>
      <description>READ THIS:
Hi guys, If you get an error while connecting to the server, it means you are on beta 1.5 which is not yet compatible with the server mod I am running (bukkit). To play on this server, you must downgrade to 1.4 until a bukkit update is released.


Have you ever wanted to just burn a server to the ground without getting banned? Now you can. At BOOMtown, a server designed specially for griefers, you are welcome to destroy the huge city you are spawned in. You may use TNT, Flint and Steel, Lava or any other tools of destruction that are generally banned at other servers. There are no whitelists or needs to obtain build rights. From the start everyone is admin and has access to all commands excluding kick and ban. There are no rules whatsoever so feel free to do anything you wish (excluding crashing the server and annoying others). Join now, because server slots are limited. Have a  fun and explosive stay at BOOMtown!

      <description>Shards of the Protectorate 1.4: (Whitelist is off during the day for visitors)
Multiplayer Survival at its Finest


Welcome to Shards of Protectorate, a fantastic world full of treasure, adventure, and danger. Your quest takes you through the world of Apexus, A world that is ripe for the conquering. Are you that conqueror?. Will you start your own shard, recruiting new citizens and building your own government that all will bow to? Or will you set off as a rouge, living in the wilderness as you steal and deceive your way to the top? The choice is yours. However, you cannot do it all on your own. You&#8217;ll meet hundreds of people during your time here, some of which will attempt to help you on your quest, while others will look to stand in your way. Your adventure awaits!

===


The gleaming city of Protectorate, the world&#8217;s governing body, and the source of all the world&#8217;s power, was created by the Rune Lords as a beacon to unite the people of our lands. It is our central hub, National market, civic center, and the world authority. Shortly after the completion of the city, the Rune Lords disappeared. Mystified and fearful, the citizens of Protectorate left the city and established Atol Shard just to the South. Since then, the people of Atol Shard and other citizens of Apexus have waited for the Rune Lords return. Recently, the discovery of World Runes has given hope of the Lords return and the peoples of Apexus have started to return to the city. An ever-improving economic situation has led many citizens to venture off into the wilderness in search of resources and wealth. Many of these travelers have used their wealth to begin forming Shards of their own.


Features:
Launching with 35 slots and Ventrilo.
Donator Levels with unique gifts.
Towny, iConomy, Chest Shops, and other gameplay-enhancing plugins.
PVE, PVP, Lite RP
Dedicated Staff.
Lots of freakin&#8217; chickens. Seriously, they&#8217;re everywhere.

      <description>This is going to be the YL gaming server we have already built the basic town area for any players who wish to join and any player is allowed to build outside of the regions we have set so we can expand and make a huge city. The town includes a furnace area, bank, exchange,bakery and much more. you can however, pay around &#163;2 and get some commands from us, the admins. We are still undecided on the prices as of yet but we will sort that soon. No griefing will be appreciated and a ban would be in place if you do. The server is whitelisted so just message any of the admins via their youtube account just search for ylgamingyl and you will find the channel. Thank you.</description>

      <name>Minecraft new epic server with flyhax enabled and soon bukkit 1.5</name>
      <description>My first server ever. Hoping to get Bukkit 1.5 when it comes out. There will be 5 ops at first and gradually more and more will surface. No griefing other people's property please. This is a pvp server and a building server. Monsters are currently disabled and will be enabled later. We can fit 20 people and pvp is enabled. We will not tolerate flying over someone and killling them. You can fly but not for pvp uses. We have 2 ops atm.

      <name>Svensk Minecraft Server - Minesville.net</name>
      <description>Minesville.net is one of the largest Minecraft Servers!
A while ago, we where minesville.se, and for a time the biggest in Sweden!
Now we focus on good community, and quality, join us today!

The server we have is a fast dedicated machine, which guarantees zero lag.
The hardware of the server is an Intel 760, 8Gb Ram, Dual Intel X-25 80GB in RAID0 and everything is on a steady-gigabit line from the city network.
We have had the most online was 96, but the average is around 35-40 every night.
Sometimes less, but there are always people online, so you do not want to be alone!

The server is focused on building, and the map we are running on right now is about one week old.
You spawns in the capital, and can have a plot there if you want.
Would you rather pull out on your own adventure and start your own city, it is just fine!
We also have an architectural group, which adorns the map with special buildings and pixel art.
A live map is available here; http://mc.minesville.net:1337/

We usually also run Survivor Matches sometimes, more info to come.

Our server requires withelist applications.
And you must be 15+ to play here!

      <description>This is our anarchy server, since we are still in 1.5 and bukkit is not updated yet we currently have no mods, but as soon as it is updated i will be adding runecraft, iconomy, shops, party system, mcmmo, and a few others that are not so well known. No protection. Admins: colbysmindcraft and prolawler. Griefing is allowed and stealing too. Protip: dont build by spawn, you will get owned. Dont complain when your stuff gets stolen because we hate whiners. </description>

      <description>This is my brand-new server made a few days ago. There's no stupid whitelist or paid stuff, and you don't need to make an account on some website that you won't ever visit for build rights. 

This server will be heavily modded, hopefully with planes, humans, cuboid, bukkit, iconomy, etc. However, i realize some of my players won't like all the mods so only certain mods will be in use at a given time and will change per hour. 

I'm not sure how often the server will be up, I am still coming up with some sort of schedule, but this computer is shared so it won't be 100% until I have my own computer. (sorry) That shouldn't be too long though, no longer than a couple months. On the weekends uptime will be hopefully 70% - 85%. I'm hoping for it to happen this weekend though. (Unlikely) (my computer is broken, I have to completely restore the hard drive and re-install the op. system with a boot disk. What a pain. Oh well. Feel free to join if its online, to build just find land you like and ask me or an op if it will work. Try to keep it close to civilization, to reduce lag.

Rules:
USE COMMON SENSE
Don't grief
Don't Spleef (except obviously in the designated arena in a game) 
Listen to and obey higher ranks

please email me if you have questions or comments.

      <description>Recently A lot of changes have caused us to fall from this listing. the main cause being a Host change And the Ip changing in the process.

All info is now up to date.

The server is 24 slots hosted by Brohoster.com 

Runs a stable Bukkit and a good handful of plugins.

Highlights of the plugins:

Piston-mod (yes there is a server version all be it just a normal iron block.)
LWC
LogBlock (Greifers will be banned.)
Iconomy
Sign Shops. (for players)

Some form of quest/mission coming soon.

Server has a   200x200 Build Box meaning all new players can not Greif the players buildings. 
New players much build a nice house in order to leave the box.

      <description>Good day. I will now welcome you to the Garden of Tranquility. We're an international and whitelisted server based in Sweden and we do currently run on Bukkit, where we are using a RPG like plugin (More information on that further down) and some other plugins to ensure the safety and protection of our community members, and to further enhance the gameplay.

We currently have a 4 active operators (Including me) on our beta server that's online most of the time and will handle your questions properly.

List of operators
Kromgol
Malmbin
TehGingaNinja
TehGritz
GhostOfRazgriz

Seeing as we try to do everything to prevent griefing we're going to be a whitelisted application only server, and this due to ensure the quality of our visitors being the most excellent experience.
To apply, please include these things in your application that you'll either post in the forum thread or send a PM to me.

1. Your in-game name.
2. Why you want to play on this server.
3. Why you are interested in playing Minecraft.
4. Add something else if you wish.

We don't tend to keep us to rules that much, as long as you don't grief or harass, you're fine.

We have also set up a RPG based system now with some great mechanics that will most probably enhance the experience on our server.
The RPG modification is called mcMMO, this will enable you to get skills in Woodcutting, combat (Swordsmanship/Arching/Unarmed), Mining, Excavation (Diggin'!) and Herbalism (Growing wheat, flowers etc.) which will give you in higher levels more damage done to enemies, special abilities, more drops, more experience and such. We do also allow parties now with a special party chat for your party.
You can also make an anvil through placing an iron block, and then repairing axes and such through right clicking on it if you have the right ingredients for it.

You can find more info here: http://mcmmo.wikia.com/wiki/McMMO_Wiki or /mcc in-game, so please, do not ask me about everything that you don't understand. 

We will not have a true RPG setting in-game through forcing everyone to roleplay, but do it if you wish. But don't get angry if the others doesn't do that.

The shiny and sanguine worlds were pre-generated to ~4500x4500 blocks using bucyruss' original BiomeTerrainMod, the vanilla world is standard beta server fare, and the hades world is a small nether environment.

New players will initially have build rights in sanguine only so they should take a portal to sanguine if they want to start building right away, but they are welcome to explore the other worlds. Users wanting build rights elsewhere can request them from our Creative Director (Sykotik) or one of the mods.</description>

      <description>The best server on Planet Earth. You start off with a small town called SpawnTown. In spawnTown there is shops, houses, theaters, and all sorts of stuff, just make sure you don't go in the admin house or you go straight to jail. For a Minecraft Day of course. Then if you get tired of spawn town you can take a subway train to Paradise Island. The meaning is in the name! It's a paradise! Basically a big city. Theres hotels, houses, stores, pubs, and even a water park! On the opposite side of course! 
Also If you don't like either one you can ask an admin to assign you a spot and you ccan build there.
Of course like most servers there are rules:

No griefing
No swearing 
No asking admins to spawn items for you
Tnt is banned to guests and members, designers are exempted.
No asking to be an op.
Flint and steel is banned

If you want you can purchase houses in certain cities.
Certain cities are:

Paradise Island

Personnally both Spawntown and Paradise Island are great areas. Spawntown is straight forward. Paradise Island is the city in lights at night. Anyways we welcome you to our server and can't wait to see you there!

Moderated by Mactownes and falconfund. We have bukkit, and we have many fun plugins to enhance the experience. We have stackable fences, item spawning, and even FLYING! Once you build something, you can have it protected to protect against griefers. The server is normally on 24/7, so come on in and have a good time!</description>

      <description>Basically an epic freebuild server right now. People are free to explore the map as they wish, and if they want to build, they need only to join the forums and post a topic in the Member Applications forum. New users are often approved within the same day.

There are definite future plans for a PvP only battle/fight server of sorts, and a bare-bones PvE server (for the quintessential Minecraft survival experience).

The more active you are, the quicker you'll gain privileges.

      <description>I just got finished setting up a server box as I wanted to try out my own server for a little while. The servers I've joined seemed too advanced (castles and towns that looked like 100+ hours of work) so I'm keeping this one very vanilla for now.

Server: 71.192.78.79:25565

Server is whitelisted so if you get kicked please try again in a couple minutes. I'll have added you to the white list usually by then, if not, within 24 hours.

This is a pure survivor server, no OPs, giving items, or the like. Any questions/concerns PM on the Minecraft forums: highwindcid</description>

      <description>I created this server to provide a great place for people to come together and have a great time. The one thing I came across on other servers was the overwhelming amount of griefers, and the constant map changes. On CAK, expect to see little to no grief as we value our well protected servers. Map changes, or starting over, will only occur if our community agrees we should. Our well picked group of admins and moderators have the tools they need to fight grief and theft, with such features as ban, jail, and even plugins to allow us to track down thieves. As you may see, griefing will not be tolerated on this server, anyone caught griefing will most likey suffer an immediate ban. This server has plugins, such as MC MMO, that allow our players to rank up and attain new abilites to improve what they can do on this server. MC MMO has features that allow skill progression through training, or just playing on our server, that will give special abilities such as Double Drops, Fire Arrows, Dodge Roll, and many others! We have plugins to give our community an economy, and it is booming! Everyone has the ability to earn money from their fellow minecrafters, or simply by selling their items to the server itself with simple to learn commands.

      <description>[24/7 - Hardcore - Legit - Nether - Cities - iConomy - PvP/PvE - Shops - Protection]

Note: Need to apply to be on the whitelist first and have read the rules!
Griefing or theft is under zero tolerance, because of this we have very few problems of theft or griefing. Make sure you read the rules :)

A hardcore and legit server. No items are spawned, travelling around costs redstone, so dying is a real consequence. Cities can be made, which are protected and they can war, winning items or access to the nether or other dimensions. Iconomy is used and is the main way to trade, using chest shops which anyone can make.

We're online 24/7 with a very active userbase, currently holds 30 members lag-free and looking to double that soon. Updates are rather frequent and things are changed to meet needs/suggestions. Admins/mods are friendly, along with the majority of the server members.</description>

      <name>ShadowVille Medieval RP[Lots of plugins]1.5</name>
      <description>That's right folks, we are on Bukkit 1.5 now, so we have plugins, booster rails, and weather going now. It's a new map, so come find some land with a nice view quick!

We are now on a DEDICATED SERVER!! 100 Slots for now, but I'll increase if necessary. Also, this isn't one of those fake dedicated servers that other people on this site are lying about. This server is all ours! No sharing CPU or disk I/O, means we can run way more plugins than any server on a shared service. 

Come stake your claim in ShadowVille! Start out with a small hamlet and forge alliances among other leaders to give birth to a new nation! Explore the lands and pillage those below you! Quest your way to riches and create your diamond mansion...it's all possible in ShadowVille!

Feature rich server with lots of plugins, large towns and a great community! The admins are very helpful and most of the other players are friendly. There are lots of towns already created you can join one or create your own. However, you must start your adventure outside the realm of CastleTown as it is a safe zone protected from building, creepers, and PVP.

New user? Check out our guide!
Comments, questions or need help? server@mcshadowville.com or you can email staff individually with the @mcshadowville.com domain, such as protchnu@mcshadowville.com

We are running on Bukkit, so there are many plugins!
Here's a list of of our featured plugins:
 Essentials
Towny
 iConomy
 LWC
 LogBlock
 War
 uQuest
 WorldGuard
 LocalShops

Moderators

We have TeamSpeak!

Admins will not hesitate to ban you for breaking rules.

Log Block is running and grieving will not be tolerated!

      <name>[German] XCraft Server [Survival | No Whitelist | MultiWorld </name>
      <description>XCraft ist ein Survival Server, bestehend seit dem 9.03.2011, der den Spielern die M&#246;glichkeit bietet, in einer Stadt neben vielen anderen Mitspielern ein Grundst&#252;ck zu bekommen, und dieses frei nach seinen Vorstellungen, ohne irgendwelche Anspr&#252;che von Admins, gestalten zu k&#246;nnen ! Au&#223;erdem habt ihr durch CraftBook viele weitere Funktionen, die das "normale" Spiel nicht bietet, wie z.B Gates, Elevators, uvm. !
Zudem bieten wir ein Ingame-Money-System, mit dem ihr Coins durch erledigen von Quest, t&#246;ten von Monstern oder auch durch verkaufen von Items an andere Spieler sammeln k&#246;nnt, um euch davon wieder neue Items zu kaufen, wie z.B. Glowstone, Obsidian, Clay und alles was das Herz begehrt ! 
In der Stadt seid ihr automatisch vor Griefing-angriffen gesch&#252;tzt, und braucht keine Angst zu haben, dass ihr eines Morgens vor einem halben Haus und leer ger&#228;umten Truhen steht. Solltet ihr ausserhalb der Stadt bauen wollen, protecten wir euch euer Gebiet dann nat&#252;rlich auch.
Ein leichteres spielen miteinander bietet unser Teleporting-System. So k&#246;nnt ihr mit /tpa [Spielername] einen anderen Spieler fragen, ob ihr euch zu ihm teleportieren k&#246;nnt, was das Spielen zu 2. erleichtert ! Alle Commands findet ihr auch in unserem Wiki : COMING SOON

Besucht doch einfach mal unsere Homepage : xcraft.de

      <description>This server gives you an outstanding amount of resources that you'd be able to use. It's a work in progress and people are just starting to join so that some people can build and some people can't. It's not up 24/7 but when I am at my house, it is up. I am not running the server on the greatest computer so that's why I limited the amount of members to 8. No more than that or the server will get reallyy laggy! Don't complain, I know that there is lagg, I am currently looking for a new CPU so I can run server a lot easier. Anyways, enjoy!

      <name>&#9608; &#9608; BlockHeaven 1.5 &#9608; &#9608; [Towny][LWC][EU 24/7 NoLag][50 Slot]</name>
      <description>BlockHeaven is a nice place for nice players. We are an awesome community on a lag free, grief proof "extended vanilla" server.

 Towny towns
Players are able to create their own (protected!) towns, sell/buy plots to/from other players, tax them and much much more. We have 7 player-driven towns so far!

 Grief proof
LWC allows easy protection of chests, furnaces and even doors. Towns are protected by default (everything configurable) and all block changes are logged and can be rollbacked without any harm to other players.

 Economy
The economy is an essential part of the play on BlockHeaven. There are a bunch of possibilities to make and give out money (from warps over castes to nations). We have a handcrafted activity mod which gives you income based on activity too.

 Castes
We have an easy to understand castes system. Currently there are 3 castes (Builder, Trader, Politician) with 2 ranks (Basic, Gold) each. Detailed information can be found in our forum.

 Chat channels
Global, local, trade and town/nation chat. You only follow the chat that interests you.

 Falsebook (CraftBook) and MinecraftMania
Build toggleable gates, bridges and alot more special mechanics and even ICs.

 Monsters 
We have animals and monsters enabled. Creepers are nerfed to not damage blocks in main world. You even get economy coins and extra drops for killing them!

 No blocked items
You can use everything Minecraft offers: Water, Lava, FnS and even TNT. We expect common sense from our players though.

 Seperate mining world
There is a seperate mining world which gets resetted regulary, so we always have resources to gather and the main world won't be damaged.

 Lag-Free dedicated server 
BlockHeaven runs on a optimized, high speed dedicated server with an awesome connection. No shared resources like other servers!

And much more! Come in and find out - visitors welcome.</description>

      <name>Untamed Wilds OLD</name>
      <description>Untamed Wilds is a loosely regulated server.  We virtually have no laws.  You still need a little common sense, and a light hearted attitude towards the game, but we welcome anyone and everyone to join us.  It's first and foremost a server for myself (Qwert1484) and a few of my friends to do whatever we want, but if you'd like to join us, the more the merrier.  There is no real theme, setting, goal, or anything of that nature to the server.  Just log in, and fart around, that's what it's here for.  

We do not use a whitelist or require build rights on our server.  Anyone may join and immidiately start building.  Be warned though, as our server has few rules, things like griefing are common, and not even frowned upon here.  You can buy protected regions for in game currency from one of the admins, and there's typically one on a few times a day.  Chests may be locked here as well, this feature is free for the moment, though we may charge a small sum for it later pending we can find a plugin for that functionality. PVP is on as well as Monsters and the nether, you can simply build your own portal as you would in SSP.  

Players are able to teleport to each other, and to a set home location, where they should also spawn.  You may also return to the server's default spawn with another in game command. We also have a live map for those of you who would like to know where you are in our world.   The world's size is not presently limited, though if it becomes an issue, we may restrict it to 100kx100k blocks, for now though, this is not in the forseeable future.  We have a currency system you may pay other users with, though it is not iconomy.

And finally, for those curious, the three rules are...  
1 No spitting.  It's gross and this is how the plague was spread.   
2 Don't do anything to intentionally lag the server or cause downtime for everyone else.   This includes dummy redstone circuits and large sums of tnt going off en masse or just using plugins that cause intermittant hangs and crashes or whatever else in that regard.
3 No client mods, exploits, or hacks.   These are just awful for the server's stability with Bukkit's unstable state at the present time.  We kindly ask you not to fly, speedhack, or edit your onboard memory to gain items and things of this nature.  This also includes destroying things within protected regions, if you're unsure if the cubes your killing are protected, right click with string equipped.  Zans minimod for example, after some research on google, was apparently causing map corruption on some servers, which is another good reason why we don't like people using these here.

We run a Bukkit server running a small fistful of mods, and we're open to more suggestions to some degree, and it never hurts to ask, so please do feel free.  The mods we run at the moment are Minecart Mania, Craftbook (the vehicles are removed in favor of minecart mania), Lightweight Chest Protection, Dynmap (our livemap), NoCheat (to detect flying speedhacks and stuff), WorldEdit, and WorldGuard.

Most commands can be purchased from an admin on either a 1 time use basis for a nominal fee of in game currency, which varies depending on the action preformed, or simply buy permission to use said command forever.  These prices have not yet been set, but we can certainly work something out in game.

The commands available to you as a player are as follows, 
/balance --how much money you have
/depth --distance from sea level
/getpos --your x y z co-ords
/help --lists ALL the commands on the server, even admin ones, you can't use them all but feel free to peek
/helpop message --Sends message to online admins and mods, remember to put a question or the like in place of message
/who  -- see who's online
/list  -- see who's online
/mail send player message -- sends message to player replace player and message with a player and a message
/mail read -- read your mail
/me  --your basic emote command, no spitting though &gt;:|
/msg player message -- whispers message to player, replace player with a player and message with a message
/pay player amount -- Pays a player the amount specified, again, replace these with a player and an amount in numbers
/sethome -- sets your home point to where you're standing
/home -- teleports back to your home point
/tpa player -- requests player's permission to teleport to them, they must type /tpaccept to allow or /tpdeny to deny
/tpahere player -- like above, but reverse, you summon your target to yourself instead.
/tpaccept -- accept a teleport request
/tpdeny -- deny a teleport request
/tptoggle -- Toggle recieving teleport requests
/lwc -- list help for lightweight chest protection
/cprivate -- type this and click your chest, door, workbench, furnace, dispenser, or any other inventory containing block, then left click said block, and it's protected to your name
/cpassword pass -- type this, but replace pass with whatever you want the password on the container to be, and it'll lock to people who type in the password with /lwc -u pass

      <name>Widdly Scuds Fun Server!</name>
      <description>12 slot server, small community (but willing to grow) with bukkit and quite a few plugins running.

Low admin intervention, just don't annoy people or grief other peoples things and I won't bother with you.  We have decent default grief protection, or with worldguard complete protection.

This server's future will be helped decided by its players! Got a plugin that you think would be fun? Suggest it! I am a very lenient owner and I believe in having fun, not being an ass.

CURRENT PLUGINS:
Essentials, iChat, Permissions, ClearInventory, ColoredSigns, Cookiez, DeathMessagePlugin, Lockette, Stargate, Trampolin, UnderwaterTorch, WorldEdit, WorldGuard, zombieattack.

      <description>Come join our friendly community at bioworld1.com (or our sister world at bioworld1.dyndns-ip.com).  Both are non-PVP worlds where you can freely visit as a guest or apply for build rights.  Mods are in place to reduce griefing and cheating.  All builds except a few admin areas are 100% hand-mined and hand-built.  Donations of $5/mo. or $10/qtr are suggested, but not required.

The rules are pretty basic:
1) Be Nice
2) Mine Fairly
3) Build Safely

I look forward to seeing you online!

      <name>SMP 1.5 The Game of Trolls: Towny, Runecraft, mcMMO, PvPReward, and many more!</name>
      <description>The Game of Trolls has been going strong for almost a month now with over 600 unique users connecting in the last three weeks, and we are excited for YOU to come join and test out your PVP mettle in our community! This server is a fully 1.5 compatible PVP/anarchy server managed by a group of veteran moderators/administrators from large peaceful construction communities, who wanted to try their hand at setting up something more aggressive and combat-oriented.

Towny is the primary catalyst for war--it allows you, the user, to cuboid your own stuff and manage your own factions and groups. We will be regularly enabling server-wide war mode and letting towns, nations, and even you lone wolves (we haven't forgotten about you!) duke it out for absolute supremacy and dominance! Can you outwit your competition? Are you a sneak/thief, or more of a direct diamond sword to the face kind of player? Don't know? Now's the time to come find out! We won't tell your construction buddies on your old server how ruthless a PVPer you really are. Trust us.

The admin team is working hard to expand and build up the community, create quests, npc cities to be conquered or killed for money, tweak, change and add plugins, and much more! We work hard to make sure things stay fresh.

Here's a taste of some of the plugins we're running: Towny (of course), mcMMO, Runecraft, multiVerse (with a full nether!), ecoCreature, PvPReward, HeroBounty, and much more!

We look forward to seeing you soon.

      <description>You join Mine Empire in a world of snow. Confused by your surroundings you venture off into the distance. As your journey continues you look up into the sky and you see the sun setting. So as you normally would you make a little hut to stay in during the night. As the night continues you start digging a mine under this hut. During this digging you find a vain of resources including coal,iron,gold, and most important diamond. You think for a few moments of what you can do with these then suddenly the idea strikes you like a bolt of lightning! You decide to start a town on top of this mine. Then the town becomes rich enough to start a nation! This nation after a week of hard work and digging becomes so rich and powerful that other nations want some of that power. This is the beginning of the Mine Empire Wars!

Fuel your army with the vast resources your empire has to its disposal Take over the world of Mine Empire and beyond to the point were the only safe spot is the nether.</description>

      <description>LiquidGaming Minecraft Server
	Currently running CraftBukkit using version 1.5!
	We have some great mods on our server!
	We believe that a server should not be overcrowded with
	mods that make it too unlike original Minecraft: simple, yet fun.
	You can read and see more about it in the post in our forums:
	http://www.liquidgaming.org/forums/index.php?topic=197.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Features
	 &#8226;PVP is allowed; each player can choose to have PVP on using "/pvp on"
	&#8226;Ability to lock doors/crates/whatever
	&#8226;Everyone is allowed to build outside of the city, although trusted users can use WorldEdit.
	&#8226;Blocks that you create are automatically protected from griefers
	&#8226;Survival, not focused JUST on building (although that's part of it). Have some fun.
	&#8226;Autosaves every 30 minutes (characters and map)
	&#8226;Rank system/administration system(s)
	&#8226;Good staff members
	&#8226;Community; join us today at http://www.LiquidGaming.org/
	&#8226;Lag-free server, very strong
	&#8226;Many, many other smaller or less known modifications that make the server great!</description>

      <name>Vowelcraft 24/7Freebuild Server[Bukkit, Greif Protection]</name>
      <description>We are a group of mature, friendly players who love to play minecraft!
We accept players of ALL ages as long as they follow some simple rules.
We aren't new to server hosting, and have been playing since early September '10, back when Hey0's Mod was king, and Runecraft was still being updated haha!
The server has just come back to life, after a long pause from the switch to Bukkit, and updating to 1.5!

FAQ ( PLEASE READ):

Q: How do I build?
A: Please apply at vowelcraft.bigfatmac.com. To do this, you must first Sign up (Click register at the top) then make a member application in this thread: http://vowelcraft.bigfatmac.com/index.p ... b38dad2b6b (Just copy and paste the template at the top, but remember to READ THE RULES first)

Q: Why can't I build near spawn?
A: It's protected. We really want it to look appealing when you first walk in, and a big chunk of this is organization.

Q: The server is down? WHAT DO!
A: Fix yourself up a sandwich, and wait for a day or so. If the admins think the server is going through a MAJOR update, they might switch it to Vanilla.

Q: Can I please have some "_________?"/Spawn me some "__________ NOAWWWWWW!!!"
A: No. It's a spawn free server unless you're a moderator. But I don't accept mod apps (read below) easily, so they defiantly have earned the right. A big part of it is the liability of greivers.. and I've found that people don't want to greif with stuff that they've put work into getting.

Q: Whats the banned item list?
A: Basically things like water blocks, fire blocks, TNT, etc.

Q:Are mobs disabled/animals on/health off?
A: Yes, yes, and yes (except for fire damage).

I will also kick people who I catch using bad language. However, I will permanently ban those who I catch using bad language for a second time. Also when I am not at the computer to catch you I will shut down the server until I come back on the server.</description>

      <description>100% legit. No cheating, no spawning items. 15 slots, friendly people. Drama, whining, fly hacking (and hacking in general) is banned with out a warning. A small city is protected, but beyond it is all free game with no rules. Admin will protect chests, protect property and help people build where ever and for what ever ranks. That means public people can build in the city if they request it.

Currently 1.4_01 bukkit, will be updating to 1.5 as soon as a stable bukkit version comes.</description>

      <name>Minecraft.nl Faction Wars</name>
      <description>minecraft.nl is a Faction Wars server hosted by the Mr. Green / Left4Green community, for both Dutch and international players.

Features:
- Hosted 24/7 on a dedicated quad-core server in one of the best Dutch datacenters
- No rules! Everyone is welcome. Griefing / PvP is allowed and part of the game! (Cheats and client mods are still forbidden)
- Players can create and join factions, forge alliances and obliterate enemies to become the strongest faction on the server! Intrigue and drama guaranteed! Even though you could still choose a quieter corner of the map to settle down and start a farm if you want to.
- Lots to explore! The map has been running for a while, and many factions have risen and fallen, creating a world filled with forgotten ruins and abandoned fortresses.
- Active community and forum, we have been hosting Team Fortress 2, GMod and Counter-Strike servers for years!</description>

      <description>DESCRIPTION
We are a decently new server located on the west coast and we are looking to pick up a few more players to enjoy our minecraft experience. This is a survival server. We have about 10ish active people that play on it. And we all like to have fun!

This server is running a white list, so don't waste your time trying to join without filling out an application!

RULES

1. NO GRIEFING! (Griefing is unacceptable here and will result in an immediate ban)
2. PLEASE DO NO DISRUPT OTHERS (It can be especially annoying when someone bothers you while building. Make sure they want you around before you try and help them)
3. CUT DOWN TREES ALL THE WAY (When people only cut down half a tree, it can be an eye sore. So please cut trees down all the way)
4. DO NOT KILL PEOPLE RANDOMLY (Yes, PVP is on. But please don't kill people unless you are in the arena.)

      <name>Nightmare Survival</name>
      <description>Nightmare Survival is an anarchy server, which basically means you can do anything. The reason why it is called Nightmare Survival is because you have to survive anything, like... raiders, tnt bombs, all the things you can think of. There may even be a chance of ghasts and giants spawning too! More info will be here when I can get more info.

Anarchy means:
1. A state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority.
2. Absence of government and absolute freedom of the individual, regarded as a political ideal.

It uses bukkit, but when bukkit is out of date it uses vanilla.</description>

      <description>We are a US based server. We are focused on fun with various types of gameplay. Everything is just like vanilla the only exceptions are -tnt which do not explode-, and creepers damage you but do not create creeper holes. We use only a few plugins which stop players from griefing eachother. With a maximum of 12 slots we are a smaller community but are willing to expand. This server, once grown a bit, will focus on community events. Give us a try.</description>

      <description>Dear players of Minecraft,

I have finally got my server up.  And the best things is, the server is free.  But alongside this, the server IP has a habit of changing every week.  Please check in on here and I will post the changed IP as soon as know it has changed.  Thank you and have fun.

P.S.  I told you I could do it, Snailface.

THIS SERVER IS UP ALMOST ALL THE TIME!  DO NOT LISTEN TO THE FREAKIN UPTIME THING!!!  IT IS A GLITCH</description>

Wir haben einen 32 Slot Server als City Build und Survival Gebiet. 
Weiter haben wir ein Forum wo wir uns alle miteinander Kommunizieren k&#246;nnen. 

Es gibt 2 Hauptadmins, mehrere neben Admins und Mods. 
Die User selbst, teilen sich in die Gruppen: Bau, Stammi und VIP auf. 

VIP ist bei uns ein kostenpflichtiger Status mit dem man sonder Befehle bekommt, wie z.B. /item.
